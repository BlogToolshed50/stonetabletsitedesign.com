Desire and our ability to want is often the primary reason we achieve our dreams. Take for instance, Abraham, who wanted a child so badly that he had the strength to believe in the promise of God and move forward, despite his age, until he had that child he so strongly desired.

Desire gives us the power to resolve problems and overcome the obstacles that block our path. The intensity of our desire, stemming from our faith, determines how actively we work towards our goals and dreams. The things that you truly want and vigorously care about are the fuel that you need to make things happen. Even when the outlook is grim and it seems to many that there is no hope, if you believe in your heart that it can be and you hold on to your unwavering desire then anything is possible.

A solid and intense want, a steadfast desire, is the foundation for achievement. Desire is the beginning of everything that is, was, and will be. Without a true desire, all of our dreams and hopes are nothing but wishes. Wishes are mere fantasy, without the power to be more. A dreamer who lacks desire will never be more than a dreamer. Those who don’t understand the power of the mind typically limit themselves to the simple things they can see, touch, and hear, and cast off their hopes and dreams as nothing more than a fairy tale.

A person who wholeheartedly believes in their dreams and passionately wants the ideas they imagine, on the other hand, is consistently moving closer and closer to their goal. Desire is a fervent motivator that relentlessly drives you forward, overcoming any hindrances without thinking, until your dream is a reality.

With a strong desire, you can bring about changes others never thought possible, you can make a difference in the world, and you can live your dream. Believe in yourself and have faith in your abilities. Know that you can do anything and don’t limit your true potential with barriers of doubtfulness.

Use this knowledge in your own life to reach your goals. Focus on your dreams and keep your desire consistently strong. Most importantly, believe in yourself and believe in your dreams. This simple way of thinking can accomplish anything.
