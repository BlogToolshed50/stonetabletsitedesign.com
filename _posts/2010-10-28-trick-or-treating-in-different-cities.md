Thanks to Erasmo Cortez

As a kid I would always go trick or treating with my family in the [small town](http://smalltownblog.com/) I lived in. I didn&#8217;t really mind when I was very young but as I grew older I started to want to explore other cities during Halloween. I wasn&#8217;t able to trick or treat in another town until I was about 14 years old when my parents finally let me go out on my own.

The town I grew up in was very small. Usually my family and I would go trick or treat for maybe an hour and every house would be covered. Then we would go home and watch satellite TV from [www.CannonSatellite.com](http://www.cannonsatellite.com/programming_pkgs.cfm) as we ate some of our goodies. This was what we did every year and it got boring. The first year I went out by myself, I was trick or treating for a good 2 or 3 hours, and I was hanging out with my friends around the city for even longer after that. It was a nice change of pace, and every year I started going to different cities, or neighborhoods within the same city.

So far I have only trick or treated in about 4 cities, but each city has multiple large neighborhoods that are all different in their own unique ways. Next year I hope to hit up a brand new city.
