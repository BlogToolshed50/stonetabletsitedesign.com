On game day my family just doesn&#8217;t dress themselves in school colors before we leave home. We make sure that our car is fully dressed too.

That means putting all of our team magnets and flags on the Explorer that we reserve especially for games. Most of the time I let my kids do it, they&#8217;re 10 and 13 and they&#8217;ve seen me put all the stuff on there so many times that I let them put it on to have a little fun.

Before the first game of the season I gave them the stuff and told them to get the car ready. Our 10 year old asked me something about the [flags](http://www.fanblogs.com/washington_state/005911.php "flags offers") and I thought he had asked if they went on the back windows so I said no. Well it ends up that he asked me if he should put the flags and he didn&#8217;t. We were running late that day so we had to go without the flags on the car. After that I thought about other times when I misheard things and looked up [Miracle-Ear](http://www.miracleearhearingaids.net/ "Miracle-Ear specials") and went to a center.

From now on the kids know to put the flags on the car and I can understand questions like that better so we&#8217;ll have a better game day.
