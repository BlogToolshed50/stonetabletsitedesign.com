One of my favorite shows on [Direct tv in Spokane](http://www.directstartv.com/localchannels/Washington/S/Spokane/ "Link to Direct tv in Spokane deals") is the &#8220;City,&#8221; a show that revolves around Manhattan&#8217;s fashion and social scenes. My favorite character is the shows supposed villain, [Olivia Palermo](http://www.refinery29.com/my-ny-olivia-palermos-5-fave-nyc-spots.php "Olivia Palermo site"). She is a self deemed socialite who flits between job and cocktail parties. It is really unclear what she actually does at work because she is hardly ever there and she does not see to do anything but fight with her superiors. She has no work ethic what so ever and she will often leave a camera man in search of a party when they should be back stage interviewing he designer. Olivia is often called into the office because of her inability to cooperate and because of her problems with authority. For some odd reason at the end of the day, her editors still love her because of her great style! It is crazy that this girl can get away with murder!

Yes, Olivia&#8217;s style is very chic and versatile. She can be in a flirty floral dress with day and cut off shorts the next. She always manages to be well put together no matter what her look entails. Olivia even manages to weasel her way over to Japan for some c-list party but, she gets to go for &#8220;work&#8221; because she is meeting with the Elle offices in Tokyo! Olivia gets away with anything!
