Grocery shopping must be an organized process or I will never be able to get in and out of the store. I always get caught up in the candy department or the specialty coffees. In general I try to eat very well and stick to the guidelines on the food pyramid. I keep a copy of this food pyramid handy in my purse just to make sure I get a few items from each important category. I always go food shopping once a week but try and get food for eight days since sometimes it&#8217;s just too difficult to fit it into my busy schedule. I try and go on Tuesday mornings because it seems to be the deadest time to shop and I&#8217;m not a huge fan of waiting in lines. I set the security system and head down the grocery store and try and find a great parking spot. Learn more about home security [here](http://www.securitychoice.com/reviews.html) . Parking close saves you a lot of time in walking to the car and eliminates time to search for it if I can&#8217;t remember where I parked. I start in the front with the fresh produce and deli so that by the time I get to the back of the store by the [junk food](http://www.kibo.com/kibofood/) I&#8217;ve already spent most of my budget. I shop systematically to use my time as efficient as possible. It may be a little strange but it works well for me.
