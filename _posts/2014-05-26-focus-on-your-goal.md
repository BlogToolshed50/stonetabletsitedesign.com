Imagine the what you could achieve if:

* You were 100 % focused on your goal
      
* Eliminated all self -doubt
      
* Believed it were impossible to fail. 

Are there really individuals who think like this? You bet!

I saw a story the other night about two modern day cowboys.

Their real life experiences couldn&#8217;t have been more amazing if they were written by a Hollywood screen writer.

The next time I&#8217;m tempted to &#8220;suck my thumb&#8221; and have a &#8220;pity party&#8221; I&#8217;ll think of these amazing men.

The young men are brothers and champion rodeo stars.

But one day their lives were changed by an incredible twist of fate.

The private plane they were flying in ran out of gas. The pilot couldn&#8217;t find anywhere to land safely and they crashed.

Everyone on board had a broken back except one of the brothers.

Battered and bruised he got out of the plane. Looking at the wreckage he realized the plane was about to catch fire and all the passengers inside were trapped.

Without hesitation he forgot about his own injuries, ignored the personal risk to his life and set his mind onthe goal of saving the other passengers including his brother.

He had:

* Focused on his goal
      
* Left no room for failure
      
* Took immediate action 

The interviewer said to the young man, &#8220;You must really feel like a hero?&#8221;

Stoically he replied, &#8220;No, I knew what I had to to do. I don&#8217;t think of myself as a hero.&#8221;

Amazing!

No trash talk, no in your face, just a modest young man focused on what needed to be done.

If you think he&#8217;s amazing, wait until you hear about his brother.

Wishing You Success,
