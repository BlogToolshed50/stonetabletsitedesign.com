Thanks to Ryan Howard for writing this

I just moved to a new town this past year and was concerned about the possibility of crime in my neighborhood. After talking with the local police department, I used several of their recommendations to help me feel more secure.

The number one advice the police officer gave me is to keep a home well lit. As he put it, evil seeks darkness. I actually thought this was a rather strange way to describe the importance of light around the home, but it certainly makes the point. I have installed motion sensor lights in the front and back of my house. I have a big older home with three outer doors. There is a motion sensor light now by each of them.

In addition to the lights, I have a large dog who likes to stand right at the front window and bark at people who may be walking down the sidewalk making noise at night. Just her face in the window would be enough to warn most people away!

I am also considering an [adt security](http://www.securitychoice.com/) alarm system. I am taking some time to research the best choices in my area. Until I make a decision about which company to use, I feel much more secure now with my good locks, [lights](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2007/09/light_and_crime.html) and watchdog.
