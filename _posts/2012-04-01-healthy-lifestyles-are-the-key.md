Integral to our overall anatomy, the brain is probably the most important organ in our bodies because without it, we could not function. So, we need to treat it like the special organ that it is. For the person who drinks heavily, they are damaging their brain more than the person who is a modest drinker. We have long known that alcohol and other substances like drug use destroy brain cells. Most alcoholics will argue that since we only use 10% of our overall brainpower, we have plenty of spare brain cells to call on. This is more myth than reality. Drinking does nothing to activate the other 90% of our brain&#8217;s capacity, and this fallacy will cause alcoholism to destroy our organ faster than believed. As a result, if you think of that 10% we&#8217;re using as a lifetime organ, we should go to great lengths to preserve and protect it.
