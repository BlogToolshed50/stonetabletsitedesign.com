It was a funny coincidence when me and my roommate from freshman year of college found out that we were both living in New York City. We weren&#8217;t really teh best of friends so we didn&#8217;t keep up with each other all that much after we both got apartments with our friends sophomore year.

I knew that she had interned at an accounting firm there one summer and then I found out that we were actually living across the block from each other! I was glad that I had gone to [www.cleartvbundle.com](http://www.cleartvbundle.com/internet_tv_bundle_deals.html "Click here for www.cleartvbundle.com specials") and signed up for a new internet service so I could gchat with her and figure out that we were practically neighbors.

We weren&#8217;t the best of friends, but we were living so close together that we couldn&#8217;t get together so we went to a nearby [bagel shop](http://evgrieve.com/2010/07/coming-this-fall-to-avenue-tompkins.html) to get brunch one Saturday morning. It ends up that we both had done a lot of maturing over the years and gotten along really well now. We&#8217;ve been hanging out a lot lately and even watched True Blood together this summer.
