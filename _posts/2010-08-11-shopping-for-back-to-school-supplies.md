The back to school time can be hectic because you are winding down your [summer vacation](http://www.hawaii-aloha.com/blog/) and perhaps dropping all of your bags to rush out the door and shop for what you need to go back to school. When it comes to shopping for school supplies there are a few things you can do to ease the rush and make your situation more organized and seamless. While you are on summer vacation or when you have a free afternoon at the beach at the end of the summer take out a note pad and write down everything you will need for back to school.

Number the list and start with a backpack, then take out your class list for the coming fall. Go through each class and think about the supplies you will need for each class. Obviously for your math and science classes you will want to get a notebook and some pens but for your art class it may not be necessary to go equipped with notebooks and pencils. Think about what you will need for your home student desk as well because you will need certain supplies in order to do your homework and study at home like note cards, hilighters, and paper organizers. Just make sure in all the rush that you set your [ADT in Illinois](http://www.home-alarm-systems.com/adt-home-alarms/Illinois)alarm before you leave home.
