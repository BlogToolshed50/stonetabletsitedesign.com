Nothing beats the classics. I grew up watching all the Hanna Barbera children&#8217;s cartoon shows like the Jetsons, Flintstones and whatnot, but I&#8217;d say my favorite has to be [Scooby-Doo](http://www.antihumanism.com/2010/06/scooby-doo-and-the-watain-mystery/ "Link to Scooby-Doo site"). To my surprise, new episodes &#8211; called Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated &#8211; are still being shown on satellite TV from [www.tvbydirect.com](http://www.tvbydirect.com/directv-deals.html) to this day.

The show has four teens and a dog named Scooby-Doo going around solving mysteries while driving around in their van, the mystery machine. The show always has some element of Halloween tied into it &#8211; with crimes being conducted by supernatural beings who end up being normal human beings wearing some sort of costume. The teens are led by Fred Jones, along with brainy Velma Dinkley, Daphne Blake and Norville &#8220;Shaggy&#8221; Rogers. My favorite character has always been Shaggy. Outside of the fact that I like his nickname, I really don&#8217;t know why I like him so much. He and his dog Scooby-Doo are very similar, but for some reason I enjoy his voracious appetite and scaredy cat ways much more than I do Scooby&#8217;s. Still, those two really make the show.

The best part is that I get to relive my fondness for Hanna Barbera produced cartoon characters with my own kids 20 some years later. I definitely would recommend that any fans of the old show share the new version with their kids.
