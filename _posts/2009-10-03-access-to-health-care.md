It is important to everyone. The quality of health care available to people vary widely depending on the number of doctors. In the developing countries excluding Sri Lanka, Cuba and Costa Rica there are only few doctors available. In all the countries, more doctors are in town than in the countryside. This is because the doctors make more money working in urban areas as their costs are spread over more patients. The other services which provide local health care are pharmacies and dentists.

The measure of access to health care is the percentage of economic resources or Gross Domestic Product (GDP) spent on health. Spending on health in the USA is higher because it has only private health care system funded by insurance payments. Spending more on health care does not always guarantee good health. There is no direct link between percentage of GDP spent on health and increased life expectancy. IMF estimated that in 1999. 2.1% of GDP is spent by poor countries. And 30% of the people belonging to those countries had experienced a health benefit and only 13 percent of the poorest has benefited.

Access to health care can also be measured by the number of spaces in clinics and hospitals relive to the population of the country. Local clinics and community health workers play an important role in improving people&#8217;s health in the developing countries.
