Now the financial crisis is affecting the globe to a greater extent and the entire world is reeling under the economic contraction. Many economists have come out with the various reasons for the present scenario. Some view the present banking regulations in various countries is not up to the mark to arrest the debacle. While many opined that the banks and other financial institutions had not insulated themselves with the needed risk management. I personally feel that, the financial institutions had not prepared with the buffer out of their profit to face the crisis.

Lack of international co ordination to the extent needed was also absent, leading to the present precarious condition. It is high time that the right risk management policy is put in to place by standardizing the norms at international level. Funding to the unproductive sector should have a cap and the regulator should monitor the movement very closely. The saving habit need to be inculcated in the minds of the citizens to meet out the eventuality.

Of late the financial institutions in their greed to grow fast, expand the credit to the unproductive sectors and end up with increased toxic assets. The asset liability mismatch also come in their way to maintain the liquidity position. Unless these aspects are attacked in a systematic manner, the financial crisis will be a continuous process affecting the health of the economy globally resulting in the social unrest and turbulence.
