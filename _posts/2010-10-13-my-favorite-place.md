The zoo has and always will be my favorite place in the world, because I feel there I am truly at home. As a budding naturist, I see the zoo as a place that epitomizes ideal living. All those animals comfortably in the nude, being watched by jealous passers by who think themselves superior. As we too are animals, I do see the hypocrisy in our judgment of them. It is the animals, however, who judge us, as in the hot summer days we foolishly don clothes and walk around fanning ourselves, when all we really need to do is be naked and free.

When I watch the killer whales and dolphins dance in the water, I do wonder if the best thing to be is a mammal that acts like a fish. The water is the ideal [temperature](http://www.blogtoplist.com/tags/Temperature "temperature deal") in the summer, and when it is not, you can just swim deeper with the ugly fish. Perhaps evolution had it backwards, putting us on land. When I go to the zoo I think about this, and the possibility of a city of Atlantis in the deep where man has evolved properly and does not have to sit under the hammering sun. Then I realize all the dangers that exist on land, especially burglars. Thankfully at least that part is covered by the home security alarm([adt home security prices](http://www.inhomesecurity.net/adt-home-security-prices-packages.html)) I set before I left. The sun, not so much.
