All of my friends are always so curious about some of the innately southern things that creep out when they&#8217;re around me. I guess that you can take the girl out of the south, but you can&#8217;t take the south out of the girl because I&#8217;m walking proof of that. They&#8217;re always cracking jokes about it, even though I can tell that they&#8217;re curious about that stuff, so I thought that I would invite them over for a New Year&#8217;s Eve lunch with the typical good luck food. Of course, they all accepted the invitations and I think it will also just be a nice way to celebrate the holiday.

I send out e-invites with our [CLEAR 4G](http://www.clearwirelessinternet4g.com/clear-spot-4g.html) for it a few weeks ago and everyone RSVP&#8217;d back that they would come. Now I&#8217;m just putting together the last few things so that I can pull off the dinner without a hitch.

At my [New Year&#8217;s Day lunch](http://eatdrinkbetter.com/2008/12/31/good-luck-foods-for-the-new-year/) I&#8217;m going to serve the typical southern good luck foods of cornbread, black eyed peas and collard greens. It&#8217;s probably going to be a lot of trouble to fix all those greens, but it will be worth it.
