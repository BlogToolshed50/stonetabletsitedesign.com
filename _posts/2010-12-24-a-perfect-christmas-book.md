Nothing puts me in the Christmas spirit like snuggling up with a few sappy holiday-themed novels. So I normally start lining them up the week of Thanksgiving. However, the one thing about this year&#8217;s book lineup was that I went through them so fast that I had to find some more Christmas books to read!

I went through some of my favorite book blogs to try and figure out what other books that I could squeeze in before New Year&#8217;s. When I was searching online I came across a [CLEARINTERNET online offer](http://www.clearwirelessinternetservice.com/local_internet/kansas/clear_kansas-city_internet.html "CLEARINTERNET online offer site") and after I thought about it a little bit, I signed up for the offer. Besides, my old internet service wasn&#8217;t exactly impressing the socks off of me.

I found this one really good [Christmas book review](http://www.sarahsblogoffun.com/2010/12/first-christmas-friends-and-festivity.html) and after I glanced over it I ordered that book. I also came across some other books that I thought would be really good, so I went ahead and ordered them too. I think it would be okay to keep reading them even if it&#8217;s 2011 by that time.
