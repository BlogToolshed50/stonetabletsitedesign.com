Water security should give the utmost importance if the future generation is to get their share of this precious resource given by the nature. I was reading through an article which had depicted the very sad state of affairs with regard to the water availability in the world. The link between poverty and water availability is well stressed in the report issued by the Un agencies during their recent meeting at Istanbul. It is a point to note that at least half of the world population will be living in the water stress area by the year2030 if proper preventive action is not taken by the various nations. The water stresses will be pronounced more at African and Asian countries compared to others.

The world population is estimated to grow at a speed of 80 million per Annam and the demand for water can be correlated to this astronomical population explosion. Demand for water is growing by 64 cubic meters per year that is approximately equivalent to the annual water demand of Egypt as at today. Unless the nations come together to tackle this issue in letter and spirit, the sufferer will be the future generation. A scientific and systematic study must be carried over on an ongoing basis to closely monitor the relationship between the climate change, population growth, increasing demand for the food and other related matters with the availability of the water. Proper remedial measures must be suggested in a co ordinate manner and the nations should implement the same. 

It is high time that the general population is educated about their responsibility to conserve the water resources by simple methods like water harvesting and preserving the purity. The developing countries should also divert their attention to increase their budget allocation towards the water projects to reduce the water stress and improve the water security. In the UN report there exists a correlation between the poverty and the water resources with the number of the people living with a per day income of less than $1.25 is coinciding with the number of people living without safe water.
