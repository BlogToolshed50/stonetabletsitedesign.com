Perhaps the biggest obstacle for the stay at home business mom or dad is the kids. That screaming toddler is not going to be quiet when you have business calls or take that nap to let you get your work done. This will be the same child who will eat all of your post-its and stick food into your hard drive. You were probably envisioning no more commutes, flexible hours, and lunch with the kids’ everyday. 

Your childcare options are flexible as well that is the beauty of being self-employed. Here are some of the most common affordable ways to take care of kids while you build your family&#8217;s fortune from home:

Childcare Co-op: Find a group of work at home parents and swap off childcare duties. You can keep track of how many hours you watch each child and use the time you accrue when you need it most. The great thing about this is it is free. The downside is that you will have to give up work time to handle other people’s children.

Trading or Mom-swapping: This is the smaller version of co-op. this will involve you and a good friend trading off childcare days. Make sure you set clear boundaries about when you will take the other child and when they will take yours. You don’t want to be taken advantage of. You will also want to make sure the kids like each other and get along well. If they don’t then this will end up being a bad experience. 

To come up with inexpensive childcare solutions you must be a networking prowess. Spread the word that you are looking for childcare to everyone you knows. Think in terms of trading and business opportunities.Try your best to get the right childcare for you and not spend an arm and a leg getting it.
