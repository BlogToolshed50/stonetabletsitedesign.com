It has been proved wrong that large economies are able to withstand the impact of the economic contract that is observed globally. The stress test conducted by the International Business school IMD has given the result that smaller economies in the world are better placed to absorb the shock. Countries with less population are able to recover from the economic slowdown easily compared to the one with higher level of population. It is also interesting to note from their study that China and India are able to cope up with the impact due to diversified nature of the economy. In these countries the slowdown in few sectors of the economy is nullified with the robust growth in other sectors. Denmark is in the top rank in the test conducted by International Business school IMD and is in a healthy condition. China is ranked 18th while India is at 13th position. The study by them also indicates more chances for the cross border merger and acquisition. The study predicts that the 100 top companies in the world will be sitting on a money of about $600/ billion for investment in the shares and industrial assets. In general, the economy is bound to come back on the rail by the early 2010.
