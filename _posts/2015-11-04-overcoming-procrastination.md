What are the reasons that YOU procrastinate?

* Are you a perfectionist?

* Do you procrastinate on projects that you dislike?

* Do you over schedule yourself?

* Do you have fear of failure?

* Or maybe fear of success?

* Perhaps you dislike or disagree with the person delegating the job?

* Do you lack clear goals? 

There are many reasons for procrastination, but only one result. Stress, anxiety, and a great amount of wasted time.

A creative consultant, describes a woman who put off cleaning her desk and sorting through her paperwork for an amazing 2 years.

Her reason for procrastinating this important project?

&#8220;She realized that going through the piles and cleaning off her desk would force her to confront opportunities she&#8217;d let drop with the passing of the time,&#8221; Marcia explains. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t want to face that.&#8221;

At times that you find yourself procrastinating, Marcia recommends asking yourself these questions:

1. What purpose does your procrastination serve?

2. What could you like about the put-off job once you got started on it?

3. What wouldn&#8217;t you like about it?

4. What would be the consequences if you continue procrastinating?

5. What have you done in the past to overcome procrastination that might work for you now? 

You may also want to consider a &#8220;Pros and Cons&#8221; sheet. Simply draw a line down the center of a piece of paper. On the left side, write down all the reasons for procrastinating on a particular task. Now, on the right side, write down all of the benefits of getting started and getting the job done. Once you can see how the &#8220;Pros&#8221; outweigh the &#8220;Cons&#8221; it should be easier to get started on the project.

Here are some Time Boosting tips to help you get going in the right direction:

* Don&#8217;t try to do too much at once. Proper planning will allow you to space out a task over a few days, weeks, or months, and will keep the task from seeming so daunting.

* Don&#8217;t worry about how &#8220;perfect&#8221; the job is done. When you stop procrastinating, time will allow you to go back and tweak areas that need it. Otherwise, you will find yourself with a small window of time to complete your task, and less time to make corrections.

* Get a buddy! Find a supportive (and motivating) friend or coworker who can help you get moving on something that you are not looking forward to.

* Don&#8217;t schedule tasks for times during the day that you know that your energy level is at it&#8217;s lowest.

* Reward yourself by doing something that you like after reaching certain points in your less favorite tasks. 

Procrastination is never our friend. It lowers your productivity, and, usually, the procrastinated task doesn&#8217;t go away. I always tell my children to eat their least favorite food first at dinner, because, if they wait, they will have it left at the end. Same goes for tasks that we are not looking forward to.

Get them done first, then move on to all the good things!
