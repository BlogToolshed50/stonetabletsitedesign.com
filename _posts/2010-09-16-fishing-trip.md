One of my favorite things to do is fish. I live in a beach town, so there are plenty of places here to fish.

I like to go fishing anytime I have some free time. There are a few lakes in my [neighborhood](http://bloomingdaleneighborhood.blogspot.com/) that I like to fish in. I cannot keep the fish, but to me fishing is just relaxing. It isn&#8217;t about catching anything.

I grab up my fishing rods and reels, set my [adt alert](http://www.securitychoice.com/adt-wireless-home-security-system.html "Click here for adt alert") prior to leaving and head out for some fishing.

After spending a few hours fishing, I head home. If I have been to the lake, I usually come home empty handed, but if I have been out to the beach, then I am coming home with fish in hand.

As I am heading home, I know that when I arrive at home, everything will be safe because I set my home security alarm before leaving home.

After cleaning my fish, I fry them up and eat them. Or if I didn&#8217;t catch any fish, I still have had a great time. Another great day of fishing!
