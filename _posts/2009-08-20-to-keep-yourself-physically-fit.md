Damaged brain leads to the inaction of the living creature and more so in the case of human. Medical science is able to revive such damaged brains by various methods. But the cost involved in setting right the thing is exorbitant and cannot be met by the middle income group. Brain damage results in the Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Latest research have proved beyond doubt that, staying physically fit may slow the relentless, mind robbing progress of the Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. I recently read a news column and communicated the message through various forums to keep oneself physically fit to fight this disease.

At university of Kensas, a 76 year old man was put on treadmill after series of dexterity tests and after the physical fitness exercise over a period, he was showing excellent progress and recovery against the Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. You know, exercise is very cheap and everyone can afford to it, to keep him fit and fight the diseases naturally. It is a matter of deep concern and mind boggling to know that, as many as 5.2 million Americans now live with Alzhemer&#8217;s. The process of brain shrinkage, which is the major consequence of Alzhemer&#8217;s is less pronounced in those people who are physically fit, by doing regular exercise.

Early stage diagonalized people are coming out of this problem if they undertake physical exercise on an ongoing basis. In fact, it is astonishing to know that the undamaged parts of the brain, which controls the walking aspects had shown increased activity, when such people are put on treadmill after proper scanning. As such, we should understand the basic thing that, a healthy and disease free life can be ensured by doing simple physical exercises without any expenditure.
