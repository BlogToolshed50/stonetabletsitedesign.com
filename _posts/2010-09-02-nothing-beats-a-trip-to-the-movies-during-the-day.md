This guest post from Hong Alexander

I&#8217;ve always loved going to movies. My favorite time to go is to catch a matinee during the week. (I work from home, so I&#8217;m able to do that.) There&#8217;s just something more fun about being in the theatre on a Monday or Tuesday afternoon when you know most people are stuck at work. So I usually have some lunch at home, then around noon, I grab my wallet and keys and set my [home security systems](http://www.inhomesecurity.net/) (can&#8217;t be too careful!) and head out.

I go to the Malco Majestic 20, which is pretty close to where I live in [Memphis](http://www.memphischamber.com/). I try to catch a flick once every couple of weeks. As for what kinds of movies I see, it all depends on my mood. I don&#8217;t really have one type of movie I see. I think if I made a list of my top ten favorites, there would be one from pretty much every genre. Usually I go alone. That might seem boring or lonely to some, but I prefer it that way. I want to focus and take in every aspect of the movie I&#8217;m watching, and if there&#8217;s someone else there, they can just distract me. Anyway, once it&#8217;s all over I head home. It&#8217;s usually only around 3:00 by then, so there&#8217;s still plenty of time left in the day!
