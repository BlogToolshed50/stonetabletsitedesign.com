Thanks to Ricardo Mullins

Indoor date night with my husband is very enjoyable; after making the popcorn and pouring our drinks, I sit down on the couch with him and we turn the TV on and look through the on demand menu for a movie to watch. On demand is such a great feature to have on our satellite TV from [expertsatellite.com](http://www.expertsatellite.com/direct-tv/direct-tv-satellite-dish-indiana.html "Click here for expertsatellite.com deal") because it gives us so many options; we can control the movie by pausing it if we need to and we can watch it more than once. We also really like that we can rewind the movie to watch part of it again, like if there is a good action sequence or if we happened to miss something that was said.

I love watching romantic comedies and dramas, while my husband&#8217;s favorites are action and adventure; we usually find a good middle ground or will sometimes watch two movies if time allows before bedtime.

On demand also offers such a great selection of movies, from newly released to oldie but goodie [movies](http://www.blogsvertise.com/movies "movies offers"). It&#8217;s nice to watch an older movie, even one that we&#8217;ve already seen once or more often. We have a list of the new releases that we want to see so that we don&#8217;t forget about them and make sure to look for them in the on demand menu list.

While it is nice to go outside on a date, staying in on the comfy couch watching movies on demand while snuggling is wonderful.
