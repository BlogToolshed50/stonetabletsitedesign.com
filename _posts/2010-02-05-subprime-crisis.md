Subprime crisis has ended so many banks in red in the USA. The major factor that was attributed was the rising interest rate and the inability of the borrowers to cope up with such increase. This situation could have been averted, had there been proper assessment while advancing the fund duly taking into consideration of the repaying capacity of the borrower in-case of such interest hike. The loss in the balance sheet of many banks forced them to draw from the net worth that is not a healthy sign.
