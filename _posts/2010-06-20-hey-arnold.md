‚ÄùHey Arnold&#8221; is a great show for children, depicting the life and adventures of Arnold, an 11-year old boy. As a parent, I can&#8217;t recount how many times I have enjoyed watching this program with my children on our [directv](http://www.tvbydirect.com/directv-deals/). The show is fun and even a bit edgy.

My children enjoy [&#8221; Hey Arnold,&#8221;](http://coreywwilliams.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/good-shows-hey-arnold/) because it is a show in which they can relate to the main character. Arnold is just another ordinary boy, except he lives with his grandparents. If I recall, something tragic happened to his parents that made him have to live with his grandparents. I think the show has a poignant edge, however, it more importantly shows how Arnold is able to embrace his unique situation while have tons of friends in the community.

I think this show really teaches children how to deal with life in a fun and positive way. Even in hard situations or sad situations, Arnold finds a way to overcome such situations with his love for sports and having adventures with friends. This show is great for the way it truly captures the life of an 11-year old boy just trying to make it in a big city. Overall, I would highly recommend this show for kids of all ages. Even adults will enjoy this children&#8217;s show!
