People assume that I have terrible taste in food just because I&#8217;m a vegan. But if anything becoming a vegan has made me even more adventurous in all my cooking and the foods that I go out and try at restaurants. That also goes for Thanksgiving. I&#8217;m bringing some dishes to my family Thanksgiving to make it easier on my family since I&#8217;m the only vegan in it.

I really want to make some recipes that my family is going to want to eat too so I can prove that vegan food is yummy! So that&#8217;s kept me pretty busy doing research online. When I was doing that one night last week I saw the site [clearwirewimax4g.com](http://www.clearwirewimax4g.com/clearwire_information.html "Click here for clearwirewimax4g.com deal") and decided to change over to the service after reading through the site.

One of the things that I thought would be pretty safe to fix and that people would really like even if they&#8217;re not vegans is [vegan candied yams](http://autonomieproject.wordpress.com/2008/11/16/vegan-recipe-of-the-week-vegan-candied-yams/ "vegan candied yams specials"). The regular ones are a favorite of my dadÕs and I think heÕll like them.
