Post from Kay Whisenant.

One of the coolest things about the [wildblue internet](http://get.wildblue.com/pricing.html) is being able to add photos. They can be personal, professional or public domain. These images can be added to a website, a blog post or to a fan page on such places as facebook or squidoo. It doesn&#8217;t matter what kind of site you are involved with, adding a photo only helps people to take your more seriously. 

For social networking purposes, adding a photo helps to build an online identity. This will heighten your credentials and people will take you and your plans more seriously. It is easy to add pictures to places like photo bucket in order to have easy access to them from any connection to the internet. That is one of the best parts of this very dynamic form of communication &#8212; the ability to change what you want, when you want.

This is the perfect way of storing [photos](http://photocritic.org/) online, even if you are only an occasional user. For a site such as ebay, it is essential to include a picture with your auction listing. On average, these items sell for up to 25% more than those good not outfitted with a photo or two. There is no limit to putting photos online. A variety of hosting places offer personal folders to help keep these separate and make the experience easier.
