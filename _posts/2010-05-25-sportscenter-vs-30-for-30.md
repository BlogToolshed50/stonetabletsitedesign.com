ESPN is typically a network reserved for Sportscenter and televised [sporting events](http://www.tickco.com/) only. Only people that are crazy for sports or casually need to check out the scores or highlights for a particular game. But recently I have found a show called 30 for 30. It&#8217;s a documentary of sorts that highlights a particular era, individual, team, or controversy that shook up the sporting world at some point in time. The episodes are directed by film directors, and the quality is high. But it is the characters and the nuances in the story that are the most powerful. These are real people, and each story told likes to emphasize the fact that their lives are about more than sports. That their lives have more to them than just the headlines we read in the sports section.

One particularly good episode I watched focused on the days and months leading up to the Muhammad Ali v. Larry Holmes heavyweight fight. For many, the fight signified the end of Ali&#8217;s illustrious boxing career. Being such a beloved sports icon, the loss to Holmes ended up vilifying Holmes. People genuinely hated him for defeating Ali. Though he was one of the greatest boxers in history, the win that brought him the championship also tarnished and destroyed Holmes’s career. There was another underlying story line, and that was Ali&#8217;s severely fragile state. His mind and body were taking noticeable tolls from all the fights, and he was no longer as sharp as he used to be. This fight and the fact that Ali could not turn down a challenge, ultimately was a major reason for being diagnosed with Parkinson&#8217;s a few more years down the road. I love having satellite television because I am able to record these shows if I am forced to miss them for some reason. If I were asked to compare [satalite vs cable programming](http://www.bestchoicetv.com/cable-direct-tv.php) I personally think satellite TV wins every time because of my experience with both. I’m sorry I just went on a tangent but I just feel very strongly on the matter and I felt it is important to the overall article.
