The article written by Michael Mason

At this time, my favorite game show is probably [Wheel of Fortune](http://failblog.org/tag/wheel-of-fortune/). Originally hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford, the current emcee Pat Sajak and letter turner Vanna White has been around for more than 25 years now. They have grown comfortable in their roles as contestants play a modified version of hangman while spinning a wheel to determine the value of the letter they will pick.

Each person gets to guess the puzzle if their vowel or consonant is part of the phrase. They win the number of letters times the value of the space on the wheel. At this point, the choice is to solve or spin again. Most people will solve if they know the answer, but some choose to keep playing. The only problem is that the bankrupt area can wipe out the entire bank they have accumulated.

This is one of the best shows on [satellite tv](http://www.bestchoicetv.com/) as new and past episodes can be watched, adding to the enjoyment. The person with the most money among the 3 gets to play for a larger prize simply for solving one more puzzle. They are given some letters to start and get to pick 3 more consonants and one more vowel. But the pressure to solve is intensified because 10 seconds are all that is allotted. But that makes it fun.
