Who wouldn&#8217;t like the Pittsburgh Penguins? Okay, so the fans of another team might not like them. But they certainly have to admire them. We Pittsburghers take our sports seriously. We used to be the City of Champions when we had won the Stanley Cup, Super Bowl, and World Series. We have a way to go to get the Pittsburgh Pirates back on track to a championship, but our Penguins and [Steelers](http://www.steelersdepot.com/blog/ "Click here for Steelers offers") have been champions again.

Pennsylvania only has one pro hockey team as far as I&#8217;m concerned. In Pittsburgh, we have a hard time even recognizing Philadelphia as a town. I&#8217;m just kidding. We can tolerate the Philadelphia 76ers since we don&#8217;t have a pro basketball team in Pittsburgh. In PA, we actually have seven professional hockey teams, but only two are in the NHL. I told you, we take our sports seriously here.

Our Penguins are real special. Mario Lemieux started out as a player for the team, rose to stardom as an iconic player in the NHL, and then fell ill with cancer. He beat Hodgkin&#8217;s lymphoma and retired twice from playing for the Penguins. Now he owns the team. He kept our Penguins in Pittsburgh even though he didn&#8217;t have to. Now they have a new arena to play in. The games are always sold out. There is even a giant screen outside for fans to just show up and watch the games outside. We gather around at home and watch the games on [Cable TV HD DVR](http://www.directstartv.com/directv_current_offer.html).
