At the end of second world war, people all over the world lived to their mid 40s. By 1990s, they could expect to live to their mid 60s. The reason for global increase in lifespan includes better housing, water supply and sanitation, improved health care and advances in medicines like antibiotics and vaccination.

In certain parts of the developing world, AIDS has had a bid impact on these rate. For instance, the average life expectancy in some African countries has decreased significantly as a result of AIDS. Despite this, people are living longer generally. In the developed world, in countries Australia, Canada and Great Britain, men live to their mid 70s, whereas women live six years longer. In the developing world, countries like Nepal and Zimbabwe, the gap is much smaller to men and women and in some cases reversed.

AIDS does not appear very important worldwide when compared with the number of deaths due to heart disease, cancer or other infectious diseases. Heart disease is to be a major cause of death in America (34.4 percent), Europe (51.4 percent), South East Asia (28.9 percent) and the Western Pacific (31.2 percent). This is partly due to over stress, over rich diets and a demanding lifestyle. Cancers account 12.4 percent of all world deaths. So collecting these data every year enables the World Health Organization and national health organizations to trace the patterns of mortality over time.
