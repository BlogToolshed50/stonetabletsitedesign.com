“Hey You at the back of the class stop day-dreaming and pay attention!” Which one of us did not hear that phrase repeated many times in our school days? Having dreams and aspirations is an essential part of any successful entrepreneur’s makeup. But what do they do to utilize the power of those dreams? This article gives you some tips on using visualization, to achieve your goals. First to be successful in business, you need to define your personal definition of success. What is success for you? Which goals do you need to reach to be successful?

Imagine trying to sell TV advertising, in the early days when most people had not seen a television. It must have happened, or we would not have had any commercial TV today. The sales people in those days used the art of visualization to sell the concept that “a picture is worth a thousand words”

The key word here is “imagine”! I want you to imagine, or indeed create a picture of what success means to you. Sitting on a sun kissed beach or playing round after round of golf whenever you want – just create that picture.

Making that “picture in your mind’s eye” a reality

It was once said that a vision without corresponding action is a mirage – great to look at but unattainable.
  
First to be successful in business, you need to define your personal definition of success. What is success for you? Which goals do you need to reach to be successful?

Write them down, think about them, and visualize them.

Visualization is much more powerful than most people imagine. By nurturing a desired image in your mind repeatedly, you will allow yourself to be successful –easily and simply!

How to plan your objectives
  
In this positive frame of mind ask yourself exactly what it is that you do well. Check this with your best customers. Ask them how they see what you provide. Why do they like it, how would they describe the benefits of what it is you do. Finally ask them what image, your products and services, conjures up. You will find after doing this, you will have a common theme.

Does doing more of this help you achieve your goals?

Now set your objectives. They should be based on doing more of what you are good at, to reach your goals. The good news is, that having done the previous exercise, you know it will be in synch with what the market actually wants.

You need to set milestones, or short term goals to keep you honest as your plan progresses.The more you plan your objectives, the higher the chances of success. Objectives need to be realistic yet optimistic, quantifiable to be measured.

Fulfilling a strategy through visualization.
  
What you will now have done is connect a dream with reality, by setting out a set of actions or steps to help you get there. This is what the business gurus call a strategy. In reality it is a set of actionable steps, turning a dream or goal into reality.

There will be bits of the business that you just can’t do well. Don’t even try and do them, if you are not good at accounts, use an accountant. If you do not know how to market or sell, hire someone who can, if you can’t afford a full-time person, someone like 3R can help you.

There are times when you dream will go fuzzy, or out of focus, when things go wrong – don’t worry, go back to your imagination, get the image of success and focus on what did go well. It’s what the rich and famous did, and you probably already do a lot of, without knowing it!
