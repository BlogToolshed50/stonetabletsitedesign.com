Thanks to Wm Rowe

When I like to kick back and watch a little television, I think to myself&#8230;what do I want to watch today? Maybe there&#8217;s a good action movie on tonight, or hopefully [Reservoir Dogs](http://andyfrancis.blogspot.com/2010/09/my-favorite-movies-reservoir-dogs.html "Click here for Reservoir Dogs deals"), my favorite action movie of all time will be on! This is my favorite movie of all time because I&#8217;m a huge Quentin Tarantino fan.

Quentin Tarantino always makes a great action film and the movie Reservoir Dogs is really intense and emotional. Besides, Quentin Tarantino stars in the movie along with a Hollywood line up that&#8217;s perfect for any action film. There&#8217;s a deep plot involving a group of criminals and when one gets shot, they realize there&#8217;s a rat! There is a lot of twists in the plot, a gratuitous amount of gore and a killer soundtrack. Reservoir Dogs definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat!

Next time you turn on your satellite television, check out Reservoir Dogs or any Quentin Tarantino film. There&#8217;s nothing like turning all the lights off and turning the surround sound on, and watching Reservoir Dogs; especially in the comfort of your own home and on [Satalite Specials](http://www.direct.tv/direct-tv-packages.html).
