Guest post written by Mary Mitchell

Growing up, I did ballet and tap. But a lot of little girls did that. I’ve always loved to dance, but didn’t really keep up with it after grade school.

Now I just enjoy watching other people dance on TV. I much prefer these TV show competitions over their singing counterparts like “American Idol.” Watching all these shows can make it hard to keep tabs on all the contestants so I use my [clear 4g bundle](http://www.cleartvbundle.com/clear_internet_bundle.html) to stay updated.

I also stay active on the “America’s Best Dance Crew” fan in between folding towels and cooking dinner around the house. Normally it doesn’t matter what room I’m in, I’ll just prop my laptop on any level, sturdy service and use my wireless internet to browse through dance blogs.

I don’t remember a lot of the technical [dance terminology](http://www.orthopt.org/downloads/PAglossary.pdf) that they use on “So You Think You Can Dance” so I also use my computer to look up a lot of those terms. Some are called by different names than I remember using back when I was a dancer.

Besides, once you’re older like me it’s more fun to watch other people dance than do it yourself and deal with being sore the next day.
