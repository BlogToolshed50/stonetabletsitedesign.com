It is a matter of great interest to observe that few countries like United States, once regarded as the leaders in protecting the environment has gone down in the grading in the list of cleanest countries. It was nice to observe the name of Switzerland in the top as the cleanest country in the world with the pristine environment and atmosphere. Even a small country like Scandinavia is figuring in the list with clean air and less environmental pollution. In fact, the European countries have upgraded their position in the recent past while the United States could not even adopt the &#8220;Kyoto &#8216;.

Environmental regulations enacted has helped country like Europe to come out of the problem while the country like the USA got stuck. The cleanliness of the countries is measured in terms of providing clean drinking water to the public and maintaining the animal population too. It is quite interesting to note that the lack of cleanliness has resulted in the depletion of the fishery stock in various countries with dirty water and air. Those like Costa Rica with appropriate attention to their forest wealth and rich bio diversity could retain their place amongst the list of cleanest countries. 

Few African countries are handicapped with the poor quality of water and Asian countries are affected with the depleted stock of fishery. The destruction of rain-forest in the country like Brazil is found to have the ill effect on the environment and cleanliness. The Eco system vitality is the broad measure used in the matter of arriving at the list of cleanest countries. The Eco system vitality measures the health of the fisheries, the amount of greenhouse gas emitted and the clean water availability. Taking in to consideration of the Eco vitality theUSA is ranked 39th in the list with an EPI scores of 81. The Center for Environmental Law at Columbia University developed the index to highlight the cleanest countries. The laggards also can take note of their index level and plan the strategy to rise above the benchmark level to save the environment. The individual responsibility of the public is also not ruled out as we have to co operate with the regulators to improve the index.
