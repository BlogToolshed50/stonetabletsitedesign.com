This guest post from Hong Alexander

Conference championship weekend is finally here, and that means that I will be tuning in on my satellite TV that I got after seeing this [DirecTV comparison](http://www.direc4u.com/direct-tv-hd.html "DirecTV comparison site") to watch every game. It&#8217;s almost sad because it means that the college football season is almost over. The season begins in September, and December puts an end to it all. Of course, there are bowl games during parts of December and January, but the games that I anticipate every weekend are gone.

Since it is college football conference championship weekend, I will have to watch every single game. I will even watch the non-championship games just to make sure I get as much college football as I can before it&#8217;s all over. Two games stick out to me this weekend: Oregon/Oregon State and Auburn/South Carolina. Both games have national championship implications, but the Auburn game is also for the SEC Championship.

Oregon is ranked #1, while Auburn is ranked #2. I&#8217;m almost hoping both teams lose this weekend so that #3 TCU and #4 [Stanford](http://tusb.stanford.edu/ "Stanford offers") play for the national championship instead. I really like Stanford, and I believe they would make a better champion than both Oregon and Auburn combined. I will be watching intently this weekend, and I hope that it&#8217;s as good as I think it is going to be.
