Do you know that as many as 200 years ago, the cowpox was used as a week cousin to the deadly small pox. People were intentionally made to contract the cow pox with the sole purpose of fighting and resisting the dangerous small pox. The immunity developed after being infected by the cow pox was found to be very helpful to ward off the small pox disease. In fact, the basic concept behind vaccination started then. But the recent research by Henry Daniel of the University of Florida has found out a better way to approach the issue. He is working on a new kind of vaccine that is grown inside the plant cell for using as a vaccine. This material grown is crushed and put into the capsule for human consumption.

This vaccine is found to give the requisite defense against certain dreadful diseases. The immune system attacks the invader and protects against the future attack as well. It is worth mentioning that many vaccines have tamed good number of diseases which were deadly in nature once. Now the vaccines against measles, diphtheria and Polio are coming to the rescue of many. You will be surprised to know that these vaccines themselves to cause certain diseases at times. Mr. Daniel and his team is working on the new types to reduce the risk and expenditure. They are concentrating on the vaccines to develop immunity against the bubonic plague which had killed millions and is still prevalent in Africa. It is high time that every nation embark on such systematic research to thwart such deadly diseases.
