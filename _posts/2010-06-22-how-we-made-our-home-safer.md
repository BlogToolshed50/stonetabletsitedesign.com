We live in a rural suburb of Washington, DC. Neighbors and police are scarce. We have small children and their safety and security is our top priority. When the time came to increase the safety of our home, we decided to make serious changes.

The first change was to install [motion sensor flood lights](http://ths.gardenweb.com/forums/load/lighting/msg0700513524491.html). We angled them so that the range reached far into the yard and then tested it by walking from the edge of the property toward the house. We achieved a safety zone of approximately 60 meters.

Next came the [adt security cameras](http://www.securitychoice.com/adt-home-security-benefits.html) installed at the front door, driveway, and the backyard which backs to a forest and could easily be an access point for someone that wanted to sneak up unannounced. Two of the cameras were linked to our television and we can switch to the camera view at the press of a button. The third is linked to small monitor that is kept on at all times and allows us to see anyone driving up to the house.

Our last upgrade was a home security alarm system which was installed on all the windows and doors and has a 24-hour monitoring presence.
