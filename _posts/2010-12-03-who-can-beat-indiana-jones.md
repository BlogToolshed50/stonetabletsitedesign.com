I know there are a whole bunch of action movies that are filled with a huge amount of awesome special effects that can keep a viewer on the edge if his seat. I like special effects as much as the next guy, but a movie needs a story too. “Raiders of the Lost Ark” had plenty of special effects. Of course they aren&#8217;t as groundbreaking as modern movies such as “Avatar”, but they were great for the time the movie came out.

The story is right up my alley being about a college professor who takes his knowledge out into the world to track down long lost treasures of human history. What other physical treasure could be more alluring than the lost Ark of the Covenant? I mean, we are talking about the item where God would come down to the Israelites in their tabernacle in the wilderness. Now couple that with a story of Nazis trying to take the Ark and use it for evil, and it is just an adventure story that is begging to be watched.

I&#8217;ve watched this movie over and over again throughout the years. I watch it when it comes on my [directtv](http://www.tvbydirect.com/directv-deal/Keystone-WEST-VIRGINIA-WV-direct-tv.html) too. It is really cool when a channel runs a marathon of all of the Indiana Jones movies. [Harrison Ford](http://bighollywood.breitbart.com/jhanlon/2010/11/13/morning-glory-review-delightful-comedy-harrison-fords-best-role-in-years/) is getting up there in years now, but the adventures of Indy are timeless.
