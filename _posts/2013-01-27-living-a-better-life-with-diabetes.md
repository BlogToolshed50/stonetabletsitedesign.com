When they are first told by the doctor that they are diabetic many patients find themselves feeling overwhelmed. Suddenly their doctors give them many specific instructions on how to live their daily lives. From medication directions, to checking for blood sugar level and then a healthy exercising regime. For people who are not accustomed to giving themselves injections or carefully monitoring their eating habits, this can be quite a challenge. However, there are plenty of helpful ways to assist you to manage your lifestyle if you are living with diabetes.

For diabetics who have been recently diagnosed, the most important thing is to get down the basics. Ask your doctor for written instructions on when and how to take your medications and check your blood sugar levels. Getting a written diet plan that you can follow exactly will be very helpful. You will later be able to plan your meals all by yourself, but following a written menu can relieve a lot of stress in the initial couple of weeks.

Meeting a dietitian or nutritionist who specializes in diabetes care will help you understand more about what you can and cannot eat, or rather the amount that you can and cannot exceed. This nutrition expert will help you to make a diabetic diet and teach you how to follow the diet. If you need to lose weight as well, your nutritionist will help you factor that in to your eating habits.

After you have gotten used to the basics, such as checking your blood sugar, eating according to your diet, and getting regular physical activity, you can move to the next level of education. Check your local hospital or neighborhood clinics for information on classes for diabetics. Attend diabetes classes regularly to learn more about your condition and how to care for yourself and how to protect yourself from complications from diabetes.

After a certain amount of time as a diabetic, the diabetic lifestyle will become second nature to you. Once it is second nature, you won’t even have to think very hard about counting your exchanges or carbohydrate grams. Even as you reach this level of comfort, try to continue learning about diabetes. Attend advanced classes or join a support group for diabetics. Other people who have just been diagnosed with diabetes could benefit from your experience via your sharing and telling of your own personal experience. Most likely, you have picked up several “tricks” for dealing with issues such as “how to travel with medication” that tend to come up for people living with diabetes.

You may also consider joining a group such as the American Diabetes Association, which supports diabetics and diabetes research. Continue to fine-tune your care with your doctor and educate yourself on the newest health information for diabetics. Diabetes is a life-long condition, but living the diabetic lifestyle will soon become second nature!
