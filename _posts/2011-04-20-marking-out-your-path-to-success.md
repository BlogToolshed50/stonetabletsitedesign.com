Having a trading plan is not going to make you a sudden millionaire. I mean, there are a dozen things that can possible be go wrong in the market, even with a plan, that a profit isn&#8217;t exactly guaranteed. But then, it would be a lot easier if you can make the plan work. That&#8217;s essentially the crux of it all: to make the plan work for you, you have to make it work. It&#8217;s not some magic genie after all, and it needs a bit of that elbow grease to get the gears turning.

Let&#8217;s be clear here, when I talk about trading plan, I don&#8217;t mean a half-arsed list of cobbled together advice from a dozen investment books. A working trading plan is more than buy this, buy that, sell this, sell that. A trading plan should be your personality on a piece of paper with a whole lot of work attached to it. You should have put in research for your 

The very first thing that you need to make a trading plan functional for you is to make it something that you are willing and able to work with. What does that mean in terms of how it is made? It means you have to know what the trading plan is about and what its goals are. For example, if you&#8217;ve set some unrealistic profit margins for yourself in your trading plan, you&#8217;ll have no choice but to not meet them. Not meeting those profit margins is very discouraging psychologically and you&#8217;ll probably start ignoring the plan because of that, which will even more cause you problems. A trading plan starts with realistic and easy-to-meet goals and a market that you can understand. If you were a dentist or a doctor, you&#8217;d know all about the pharmaceutical market, the same goes for an engineer for the construction companies and real-estate market. Knowing what you&#8217;re getting into will always make your trading plan work and you should focus on that.
