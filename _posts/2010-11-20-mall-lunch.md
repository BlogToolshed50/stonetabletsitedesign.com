During our lunch hour, my department which consists of five people sometimes decides to have lunch together. Obviously, when you have 5 different people, it&#8217;s hard to settle on one particular place. So instead of having people who are disgruntled with their food or canceling the function altogether, we decided to have lunch over at the local [shopping mall](http://mallsofamerica.blogspot.com/) inside the food court.

At the food court, they have a Panda Express (which is a fast food Chinese food spot), a Teriyaki Chicken Bowl place called Ichiban Kan, your standard Burger Joint, a Mexican spot (the name of which escapes me), an ice cream spot called Cold Stone Creamery and some other snack, bakery and juice spots. They even have a restaurant their called BJ&#8217;s where you can call in advance and order restaurant style food as take out. The cool thing about eating at BJ&#8217;s is that they have a huge big screen to watch satellite TV from [www.DIRECTSTARTV.com](http://www.directstartv.com/ "www.DIRECTSTARTV.com offers") on during lunch. Though I usually stick to Panda Express on most of our excursions there, but I also enjoy the Vegetable and Chicken Teriyaki Bowl at Ichiban Kan. On some occasions I like to head over to Cold Stone for some ice cream or over to this snack shop called Cinnabon for some gooey cinnamon rolls. I even got a few other people in my department hooked on the stuff!
