A number of health issues occur causing a great deal of concern in the fields of genetics. In urban areas it is now easier for the doctors to identify genetic disorders. Once the mother knows that the fetus has a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome or cyclic fibrosis, will she be justified in terminating the pregnancy? What about the baby who will be only slightly disabled and should the baby given a chance of life?

The long-term impact of genetically modified food is another concern causing the public. The main advantage of genetically modified crops are that they grow quickly, sometimes they contain extra nutrients and crops are resist-ants to damage from insects and weeds. They also require only less pesticides and can feed more people for less money. For the people who live in poverty in the developing world, genetically modified crops give a chance to expand food supply and improve public health.

However, opponents say that GM crops can pollinate other non -GM crops nearby, which could lead to evolution of pests and weeds resistant to pesticides. They are also concerned about the unknown effects of eating genetically mutated foods which could produce new allergens and harmful toxins. More research still needs to find out how much substance is there to these fears.
