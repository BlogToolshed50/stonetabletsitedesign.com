As a business person, you don&#8217;t be shy about promoting your products and services and letting your prospective customers know you would like for them to purchase from you. Be direct, open and honest about it. For example, if someone emails me and asks for my advice about how to get started in an online business of their own, I&#8217;ll recommend products that I think will benefit them. Typically, I recommend Cookie Cutter and Cash Cow if they&#8217;re new to internet marketing. Why? Firstly, I believe in both products and think they give the newbie an efficient, cost-effective way of learning a lot about how online businesses work in a short period of time.

Secondly, I am an affiliate of both programs and earn $20 a pop each time I sell one. Would I recommend any products that are directly relevant to my business that I don&#8217;t have a financial interest in? No. Why? I have a profit motive. My time is money. The key is, I believe in the products. If I thought there were better products out there than the ones I was promoting I&#8217;d recommend them too. But only after I signed up as an affiliate so I could make a profit from my recommendation.

On the other hand, occasionally I&#8217;m asked to recommend a web host. I&#8217;m an inactive affiliate of one of the major web hosting companies but I never recommend them because I think they&#8217;re too expensive. In this case, I refer the enquirer to the web host I use for my own site. I&#8217;m not an affiliate of theirs and I have no financial interest in making the recommendation. I&#8217;m not particularly interested in web hosting as a product to promote so I haven&#8217;t bothered (yet) to sign up for my web host&#8217;s affiliate program. It&#8217;s just an honest recommendation, just as Cookie Cutter/Cash Cow is an honest recommendation. The only difference is, I make money on the latter and why not? The point is, so long as you&#8217;re making an honest recommendation, there&#8217;s no reason why you can&#8217;t make a profit at the same time. It&#8217;s a win-win situation. So stop being afraid to sell. It&#8217;s the reason your business exists and it won&#8217;t if you don&#8217;t.
