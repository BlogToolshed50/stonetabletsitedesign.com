Air Travel &#8211; Today air travel is one of the most widely used modes of travel. With the latest terrorist scare, many flights no longer permit you to travel with your laptop and other electronic devices. So check with your travel agent regarding any important information that you should know about.

Consolidators in the field of international air travel are the most helpful and useful source of saving a lot of money on airfare. Earlier travelers went after the travel agencies to book their air tickets, hotel, car rental etc., but now internet airline reservations has changed a lot of these things.

Many travelers take their pet dogs, cats, even birds with them on their trips when flying. So, if you are traveling with a pet, when you call the airline or travel agency to arrange your flight, you need let them know then that your pet will be traveling with you. When booking online, look for a special notations box or area and add this information. Someone will return your call and you will be able to cover this in depth. If you take all the necessary precautions, and follow your airlines recommendations, traveling by air with your pet should be easy and enjoyable for both you and your beloved traveling companion. Air sickness &#8211; is not just for people. Any animal can experience travel motion sickness too, whether it be boating motion sickness, car sickness or air sickness. Talk to your vet before you travel with your pet. Your vet might want to prescribe a motion sickness preventative prescription to give your pet before you begin your journey.

If you get dehydrated easily talk to your doctor to ensure it is safe for you to fly. The air you breathe on a plane is very dry. All airplane pressures are adjusted to accommodate the planes flying altitude. This makes one become even more dehydrated. Be sure and ask if you are allowed to bring your own water or juice on board. If not, make sure your flight has refreshments for the passengers.

Be sure to ask your booking agent about the airline&#8217;s frequent flier miles program. It is a very valuable program that offers great rewards. There is never any charge to join the program.
