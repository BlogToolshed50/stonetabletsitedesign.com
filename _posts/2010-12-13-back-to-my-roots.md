The holidays are so close, I can smell them. And maybe that&#8217;s because everywhere I go has delicious Christmas treats on sale&#8230;but it&#8217;s also because were less than 20 days away from the best time of the year! I&#8217;m definitely looking forward to binging out on my mom&#8217;s holiday cooking&#8230;and I&#8217;m even more excited to give and get presents. But, call me cheesy but the part I&#8217;m most looking forward to? Spending some quality time with the folks, and with my extended family.

Ever since I moved away to start this job in [Colorado](http://www.bouldercoloradousa.com/), I&#8217;ve really started to understand just how important family time can be. I hardly ever see them anymore, so that means I really must make the most of the time we do have together&#8211;which I&#8217;m so excited to do this year. I&#8217;ve been scouring [website](http://www.homeproimprovement.com/sears-home-improvement/florida) after website trying to find the perfect gifts for everyone, and I think I&#8217;ve done a pretty good job. Can&#8217;t wait to see their faces!
