For Christmas I got a wonderful present from my eldest son: a digital [reading device](http://www.wirelessreading-devic.com/ "Click here for reading device deals"). It stores a great number of books on it, and the screen is designed in such a way where it actually appears to be the page of a book. I absolutely love this thing. I take it with me just about everywhere I go. When I have to ride the local bus, itÕs great to have a little something to help pass the time. I also have it by my side when IÕm at home by the fireplace and when IÕm out in the community waiting for various appointments.

I always loved portable electronic devices. They really make the world a more enjoyable place. Speaking of, I need to purchase a new pair of hearing aids soon. IÕve had my current pair for a very long time. I think IÕll sign up for a [Free Hearing Test](http://www.hearingaidsbymiracleear.com/hearing_test.html "Free Hearing Test") here before too long! IÕll be sure to bring my new reading device to that appointment, as well. Maybe after my appointment I will stop in the local electronics store and see what other kinds of goodies are out on the market these days!
