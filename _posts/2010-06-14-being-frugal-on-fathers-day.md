Thanks to guest blogger Veronica Muldoon for the guest entry.

Did you know that shopping online is one of the best ways you can be frugal? Surprisingly, this is a true statement because you save money in gas and you save valuable time when shopping online with [wild blue high speed internet](http://get.wildblue.com/). Just think-next time you shop online may mean that you can put in an extra hour of overtime work at your job!

At first, I was skeptical about the idea of shopping online with [wild blue internet service](http://get.wildblue.com/pricing.html). I thought that shipping costs would just add unnecessary expenses to the gifts I wanted to purchase for my father. However, after I actually sat down and listed the costs associated with online shopping and driving to a store, I was shocked! I noticed that I saved much more money by doing my shopping online with satellite internet connection, rather than driving to the store.

Many people do not consider that with rising gas prices, driving is an everyday expense. Every time you drive the car, you are essentially paying money to go somewhere. Instead, why not do your shopping at home and save possibly hundreds of dollars in gas expenses? After I did my shopping online, I calculated over one thousand dollars in savings for the entire year! Isn&#8217;t that amazing? I have learned that the best way I can be frugal in my own life is through online shopping with my [high speed internet OK](http://get.wildblue.com/internet-provider/oklahoma/) connection!.
