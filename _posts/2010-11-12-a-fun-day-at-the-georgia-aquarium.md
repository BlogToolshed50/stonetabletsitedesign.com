My family and I love to go to the aquarium in Atlanta, Georgia. We have renewed our season passes to the Georgia Aquarium every year since they opened. There is so much to see and do there; it really is a great day trip. We get up early, pack snacks and drinks to take with us, set our home security alarm ([information](http://www.allhomesecurity.com/adt-home-security-equipment.html "Click here for information specials")) and then head to Atlanta for a fun filled day. As soon as we get inside the aquarium, we head straight to see the otters. We love hanging out and watching the otters zoom through the water. Next we venture over to see my [personal](http://www.blogcatalog.com/category/personal/ "personal offers") favorites, the penguins. They are hilarious as they line up to dive in the water. There always seems to be an impatient one that cannot wait for his turn and will push the penguin ahead of him into the water. We never get tired of laughing over their antics.

My son absolutely loves to check out the sharks. You get an awesome view of them as well as many other interesting creatures as you go through the enclosed underwater tunnel. When we get a little tired and want to take a rest, we head over to the huge tank that houses the massive whale sharks. You can sit on the floor in front of the tank and watch all sorts of sea life swim by. We so enjoy visiting the aquarium and getting up close to so many amazing sea creatures.
