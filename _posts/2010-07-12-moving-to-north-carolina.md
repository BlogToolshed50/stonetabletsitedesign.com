Thanks to Jeffery Lancaster for the post.

I remember when I moved to [Charlotte](http://www.charlottefoodblog.com/) I didn&#8217;t feel quite so lost. This is due to the fact that I first visited the city before hand and made some inquiries concerning jobs and social services. Whatever line of work you&#8217;re in you may want to see who&#8217;s hiring by going online to that city&#8217;s job site and placing an employment application with that company. If all else fails you can also put an application in at the temp service. Temp services are a good source to start at when you&#8217;re looking for work and need to survive until something permanent comes along.

I then searched the internet for local hospitals and schools. I wanted to move within walking distance of these two businesses if possible. It&#8217;s important to familiarize self with your surroundings. You can start by locating banks, hospitals, schools, parks, and social service offices. If possible get to know your neighborhood before you make a final decision to move in. Check on the crime rate, and emergency response time, for ambulance service and law enforcement.

Next, I checked the utility authorities to see if they required a deposit for new service or if I could have my existing [home security Adt](http://www.inhomesecurity.net/adt-home-security-benefits.html) transferred. It&#8217;s important that you have everything already turned on a week before your scheduled move just in case there are problems with the house.
