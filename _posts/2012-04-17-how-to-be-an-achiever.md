Go back to your school days. Think of some friends who could never finish their examinations? They always had some or the other excuse to leave few questions unanswered. In our life, we come across people who never finish what they begin. They are always having some very good excuse for not finishing the given task. These people never achieve anything in their life and are full of complaints about their fate, their friends, their family, and the world in general.

On the other side, we find some star performers, who finish the most difficult work finding different ways and overcoming insurmountable obstacles. Why this difference? If you study carefully, a non-achiever will always begin a work with great enthusiasm, then slowly the enthusiasm will get replaced by tiredness and excuses and by the time they were supposed to finish, they would have invented excuses. Whereas though the achievers don&#8217;t show great enthusiasm in the beginning, one can see that they are studying the situation. After some study, they plan out the way to finish the task and then begin. They stop only after finishing it. Right from beginning, you will find determination in them that they would be able to do it.

Can we turn a non-achiever in an achiever. Yes. It can be done. The first step is to talk to the non-achiever and without hurting his/her self esteem, point it out that the achievements are very low. Then in a friendly manner, and without making any criticism, ask them for the reasons. They will come out with their old script of how things never turn out right for them. Listen them out. Don&#8217;t get irritated. Don&#8217;t show any other expression but understanding on your face. Let them know that you are for them and not against them. Tell them that you understand what they say.

Now is the time to plan something with them. Give them a small task and monitor the progress. As they proceed, you will see the signs written earlier. At this juncture, gently show them different ways to finish the work and tell them that the happiness of completing the job will be much greater than the happiness of blaming others if the job remains incomplete. Carry out this exercise with them few more times and they will begin to realize their mistake. They will slowly begin achieving and turn out to be a lesson for other non-achievers.

Non achievers are commonly found in the world. This problem is found by many employers in their employees, by many parents in their children and by many coaches in some members of their team. Everyone of us can not be a success from day one. We must support and contribute to the development of other personalities. If a person is a non achiever , that does not mean that he/she is a bad person. it only implies that they lack some skills. It also means that they have a different way of looking at life and get satisfaction by not achieving. Our job is to show them the right path by becoming their friends.
