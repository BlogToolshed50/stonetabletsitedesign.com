Last weekend I took a trip with my husband to [Charleston](http://www.blogsvertise.com/www.charlestonharborresort.com), South Carolina. It was almost like an anniversary honeymoon trip since we’d gone there on our actual honeymoon (we even stayed in the same hotel!) but we were celebrating a different life milestone—our retirement.

We finally both said goodbye to the work force and were ready to have our new lives commence, and in one of the prettiest places on earth. The getaway was great—and just what we needed. We went fishing, we walked through historical Charleston and, of course, we ate some of the best food we’ve ever tasted.

I was also able to surprise my husband with a retirement present I’d gotten him a few weeks before. He’d been having increasing trouble with his hearing, so I went on [MiracleEarHearingAids.net](http://www.miracleearhearingaids.net/schedule_hearing_test.html) and ordered him a set of digital hearing aids. He really loved them! He even took them for a test drive that night as we walked along the bay. All in all, it was one of the most memorable trips we’ve taken. Ah, the retired life—it’s definitely worth all those years of working.
