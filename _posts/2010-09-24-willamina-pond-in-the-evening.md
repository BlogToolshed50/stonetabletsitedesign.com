I decided to take the dogs for a hike around [Willamina Pond](http://www.all-oregon.com/warm_water_fishing.htm "Willamina Pond site") this evening since it was no longer raining. I enjoy the nice trail around the pond that allows the dogs to run and enjoy their walk. In the evening there are only two or three other people out, and they are serious walkers who pay no attention to the dogs. So after setting my security alarm we got into the car and drove over to the pond. I was actually able to find a pretty decent system at [securitychoice.com](http://www.securitychoice.com/20-tips-for-home-safety.html "securitychoice.com deal"). I was disappointed to find two couples already there with four large dogs running free. We drove to the parking lot on the far side of the pond to wait a bit hoping these people were just leaving, only to find they were just starting on the trail around the pond.

I did not dare get Buddy or Sadie out, even on leashes, for fear of there being an altercation with the other dogs. Even little Penny might be in danger of being injured by one of the large dogs if they are not other dog friendly. So we returned to our house without even getting out of our car while at the pond, a very disappointed bunch of hikers reduced to walking around our own block, which can become very boring. Hopefully we can manage our hike around the pond tomorrow.
