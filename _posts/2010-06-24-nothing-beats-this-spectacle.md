Thanks to my buddy Harry Greyson for the guest post.

The World Cup has arrived and nothing beats this spectacle of teams from around the world. Everyone seems to have their favorite players and teams no matter where you live in the world. Watching the World Cup games on satellite television gives you a perspective on how popular this game of soccer has become. I was looking for the [best cable tv offers](http://www.tvbydirect.com/directv-deals/) not too long ago so that I would be able to watch a ton of world cup soccer, but I found even better deals on satellite tv. Even though soccer does not have the following in the United States, I still find myself cheering for them. I am sure many Americans will find themselves doing the very same thing.

Names like Tim Howard and Landon Donovan may not be household names to everybody in the United States just yet, but a World Cup title will change that. No matter what sport the United States competes in they always want to be the best and that includes soccer. An interesting part of the World Cup is watching all the different teams and how they approach the game. [Soccer](http://mysoccerblog.blogspot.com/) is a sport where any team can beat another on any given day. The World Cup has really grown in popularity in the States and this should help the movement of soccer as well. I cannot wait to see how well the United States does in the Cup. I know it will be fun watching them and enjoying every goal.
