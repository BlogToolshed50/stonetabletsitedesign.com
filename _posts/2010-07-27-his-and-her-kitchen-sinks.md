Our bathroom is pretty spacious with plenty of counter space, but only one sink. All the extra [counter space](http://lipsticktocrayons.com/2010/06/add-a-little-extra-counter-space-in-the-kitchen.html) is really convenient for when I’m getting ready for work in the mornings because I can spread out my hair styling products and makeup everywhere without worrying that they’ll get in my husband’s way.

But, another room of the house that I’ve wanted his and her sinks in for quite a while is the kitchen. When we cook, we almost always cook together to decrease prep time and make eating time come on faster. It’s always seemed like prepping fruits and vegetables would be so much easier with a [double sink](http://worldwidefurniture.blogspot.com/2010/01/kitchen-sink-photos-idea.html). After a particularly cramped dinner prep a few weeks ago I finally got my husband to agree that we needed it so we called up people at [home pro sears](http://www.homeproimprovement.com/) and got them to install a double sink and new appliances while they were at it.

We tried out our new sink for the first time last night after a busy day at work and we were able to enjoy each other’s company more without fussing over the sink.
