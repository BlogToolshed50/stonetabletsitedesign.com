The other day I was standing in the check out line at the local big box store. I was trying to tune out my whiney toddler who was pointing at all the candy.

&#8216;Mommmmmmy!!!! I want candy.&#8217;

&#8216;No babe. Mommy&#8217;s not buying candy today.&#8217;

&#8216;But Mommmmmyyyyy!!!!&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry babe. Mommy said NO.&#8217;

And THAT&#8217;S when it happened.

I spotted the blue bag that changed my life.

Pretzel M&M&#8217;s. Have you TRIED these things? They are a little bit of heaven here on earth. Little bundles of chocolatey sweet and salty goodness.

They have become my [snack](http://www.viruz.com/ "snack site") of choice. I might possibly be addicted. I wait all day, hoping and praying that baby goes to bed early. Sometimes I even wake him up early from his nap just so I know he&#8217;ll be good and tired come bedtime.

I sweetly tuck him in and then head downstairs.

My [direct tv deals in Florida](http://www.expertsatellite.com/direct-tv/direct-tv-satellite-dish-florida.html "Click here for direct tv deals in Florida site") and my couch are beckoning me. But even moreso, the Pretzel M&M&#8217;s are. They call my name.

&#8216;Mommmmyyyy!&#8217;

And this time I answer the call. And my evening ends in pure bliss.
