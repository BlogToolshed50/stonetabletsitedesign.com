Families are our greatest gifts, the foundation of our nations; the purpose of our lives; the central unit of our churches and our communities. All we have and do is for our families. Whether we have children of our own, single, married, widowed or divorced, we all belong to a family.

Ten simple success tips to enrich our lives and families are:

1. Morning Daily devotion- Sing and pray, then read at least one scripture verse. If you have children, put on the armor of prayer before they leave each morning. Let them remember they are children of a Heavenly Father who loves them and of family who loves and cares for them enough to pray for them.

2. Once a week have an evening together, to pray, sing, teach and play together. Turn off the TV, phones, and radio and have fun together. Simple no cost activities like touch wood, a game of tag where you are safe touching wood, or balloon volleyball over a string, even cut yarn pieces used to outline their bodies as they lie on the floor. As they stand and see themselves, their eyes fill with joy. Simple times together brings hours of fun and joy together.

3. Service- Devoting time to serve others ennobles the heart and soul. Little ones can serve with simple tasks of drawing a picture, singing a song, smiling and just sharing their unconditional love to family members, friends, neighbors, shut-ins, retirement centers and rest homes. Look for opportunities to serve and your heart will swell and your lives increase in unity. Teenagers especially benefit from serving others. Let them choose projects and you will see amazing creativity. If at first they do not want to participate, do your service anyway without judgment or guilt and they will see the joy it brings you and your example will connect to them. A great service to a teenager is to build on the foundation of choices early on in their lives, but remembering to allow the consequences as results to occur naturally. Forcing and cajoling only breeds resentment and lack of responsibility. Doing “chores” alongside them plants seeds of memories they will long remember.

4. Having at least one meal together each day where conversation includes all without guilt or judgment where they can share experiences of the day and how they can learn from them and express their feelings freely fosters trust and positive self worth.

5. Evening family prayer together and returning thanks for our food each meal fosters gratitude and unity.
  
6. Worship together. Keeping the Sabbath day holy teaches respect and reverence for our creator and his universe, for order and self-restraint. Sending children to church or places of worship disconnects, isolates and breeds feelings of hypocrisy. Attend together, reverently, respecting each other and allowing personal growth freely. Love is the energy force that lifts and inspires. Judgment and guilt tears down self worth and percolates resentment and despair.

7. Tithing is the eternal law of prosperity that brings joy to the family and peace to the heart. Children, when taught this principle in their youth, find much joy in giving and learn great value in gratitude and giving back. Sharing principles of budgeting and finances, allowing the whole family to participate in these matters will foster imagination and willingness to create ways to contribute more to the family rather than expecting and demanding attitudes.

8. Family councils where you plan, calendar, share ideas, express concerns and delegate responsibilities. Families are the single most important unit in society. Spend more time planning and focusing on what it takes to succeed together than you do on a vacation.

9. Partners pray and council together. Assist each other to be the best. Inspire and keep each other grounded and appreciated. Be united in your approach in discipline, finances and purpose as a couple. Working together, creating a mission statement, praying together especially if there is disagreement and strife, and enjoying time together and for each other.

10. Date night once a week as a couple to keep your love and romance ever growing. If you can arrange date nights with your children where you can have time one on one with each child, that is truly valuable to keep the communication lines open, but imperative to do so as a couple first. Believe it our not, you are the most valuable force in the family and how you create the day will filter down to each in the family.

Following these principles I share with you. May they bring you as much joy as they have brought my family and me. It wasn’t always easy but it was worth it!
