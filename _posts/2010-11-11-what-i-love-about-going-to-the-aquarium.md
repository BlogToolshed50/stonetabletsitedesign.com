My favorite aquarium is the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. Anyone who has ever stepped foot in this awesome playground for kids and adults alike, can totally understand my love for the place. My favorite Sunday afternoon is spent with my two nephews and the otters and penquins at the Shedd. Watching all the animals interact and play is such a great time and it is actually a great learning tool for the kids. The shark exhibit is a fantastic journey for the whole family to see. My family loves watching the shark tank, especially when the divers are in it cleaning.

We always put safety first on our day at the aquarium. This entails making sure our [ALARM SYSTEMS](http://www.totalalarmsystems.com/adt-home-alarm-packages-pricing.html) is on when we leave our house, bringing [sunscreen](http://www.bestsunscreenblog.com/) with us on those sunny days and making sure we abide by all the aquarium rules for safety. My nephews had a hard time not running to all the different exhibits at first, but once I explained to them all the cool stuff they were missing by running, they slowed down, and now enjoy all the animals and are also being safe. Our whole family highly recommends the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago for all the cool animals and fish you can check out. Your visual senses will never get bored.
