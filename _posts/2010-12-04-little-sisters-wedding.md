Katy and Dave&#8217;s wedding was planned out perfectly. My family and I took a 10 hour roadtrip, after we sat our home security alarm system from [home-alarm-systems](http://www.home-alarm-systems.com/adt-home-alarm-system-pricing.html "home-alarm-systems deals"), to Oklahoma and stayed for 4 days. We knew that we could not miss our my sister&#8217;s wedding. Katy and I had planned out the wedding for over 6 months and everything turned out exactly had we wanted. There were flowers everywhere and everyone looked really amazing!! My husband was a big help in setting up the wedding and even though everyone was wore out we still all had a really good time. After the wedding we all went to my parents house for the reception and the weather was absolutely perfect, and fit the mood in the atmosphere. It is not that often that my family and I get to go see my parents, so the trip made was well worth it. I think my parents were really happy to see Katy so happy. We always knew she would meet the [perfect](http://www.theperfectblogtitle.blogspot.com/) guy, and now she gets to spend forever with him. I am so happy for her too!!
