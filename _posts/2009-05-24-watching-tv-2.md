Watching TV is something very common practice observed in both children and adults. We term as the &#8220;idiot Box&#8221; certifying the ill effects of watching the TV. There is a well established perception that the education of the child is completely ruined by watching the TV. My inference and impression were also almost the same until recently I come across a research study by the University of Chicago. It established through their studies that instead of being simply society&#8217;s whipping boy and the root cause of all cultural evils, Teh TV might actually increase the test scores of the children in disadvantaged homes. 

The TV if used properly can serve as the best source a lot of positive information. After 25 years of research, Alethea Huston professor of University of Texas is firm to say that, it is the content that matters. He affirms that the TV is a wonderful media which takes the kid to the various places to expose them to the world when it is practically difficult for them to have time and money to visit such places. It is amazing to know that, a standardized test of almost 350,000 6th, 7th, and 12th grade students who had more exposure to TV had revealed that they scored better in the exams compared to the one with less exposure to TV for the Chicago study. 

The level of &#8220;visual intelligence&#8221; is found to have increased considerably in the kids watching the TV for a comparatively longer period. It is better we leave the misconception the TV watching by the kids lead to deterioration.
