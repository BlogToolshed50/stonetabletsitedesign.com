Thanks to Lemuel Craft

I&#8217;m a pro at looking for quality Christmas lights. What stands out as &#8220;quality&#8221; for me is how much it looks like the person loves their lights. To me, anyone that puts out Christmas lights did me a favor and because of that, I appreciate their effort and reward them by looking at their Christmas lights and thanking them for keeping the spirit of Christmas. I&#8217;m not saying that all Christmas light displays are good. In reality, some of them are plain terrible when first looking at them. But look a little harder at those lights and you&#8217;ll see the hard work of the people that put them out for the whole world to enjoy.

Before looking at Christmas lights, I always set my home security alarm from [Best Home Security](http://www.besthomesecurity.com/adt-security-prices.html "Click here for Best Home Security specials"). It&#8217;s simple. When I come home, I want to see everything there that was there when I left. If I don&#8217;t do that, then I&#8217;m hurting. As I&#8217;ve gotten better at doing this and feeling safe while I&#8217;m away from home, I&#8217;ve enjoyed the Christmas lights more and found a lot of other reasons to be happy with the season and my family and friends in general.

Christmas really is a wonderful time of the year and those Christmas lights are a huge part of why it&#8217;s as wonderful as it is. I [recommend](http://voorheesvillereaders.blogspot.com/ "Link to recommend offers") spying a few of those lights this year.
