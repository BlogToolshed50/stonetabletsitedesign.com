There are two types of vitamins, water soluble and fat soluble. Both of these types are stored in the body in different ways.

Water soluble vitamins cannot be stored in the body. So for this reason it is important to have regular consumption or intake of these vitamins to maintain the necessary level of nutrients. Vitamin B and C are two examples of water soluble vitamins. Water soluble vitamins are also easily destroyed by overcooking foods that contain them, not storing them properly or handling them wrong. For foods that contain water soluble vitamins you should always stir-fry or steam them. To get enough water soluble vitamins in your body every day you should eat as least five fractions of fruits and vegetables.

Fat soluble vitamins are easily stored in the bodies fat cells. For this reason you do not need a daily intake of these vitamins. Vitamins A, D, E and K are examples of fat soluble vitamins. For these vitamins the body will use what it needs when it needs them. In addition, these vitamins are easily used by the body since they are already in the fat cells.

In order to maintain the effectiveness of vitamins you should make sure they are stored properly. Proper storage is often making sure they are kept in a dry place at the proper temperature required for each vitamin and preferably in a container that has a screw top lid. Whenever you plan on storing vitamins you should always check the expiration date and remember these dates or check them continuously so that you will know when it is best to consume the vitamins. Consuming vitamins that are expired means the vitamins may be ineffective and at the same time they may also be harmful to your body.
