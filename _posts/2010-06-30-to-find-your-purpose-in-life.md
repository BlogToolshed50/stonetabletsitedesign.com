If you want to find your purpose. One of the important area for identifying your purpose is discovering the spiritual part of you. You must become spiritually centered and develop a spiritual relationship with God. Some people don’t believe that there is a God, but just because the belief exists, does not mean that the belief is truth and nor does it mean that God does not exist. Research has suggested that people who have engaged and nurtured a personal relationship with God live healthier, happier, successful and longer lives than those who do not. It is out of the spiritual you that you will determine and establish your moral and value system. Your own beliefs of right and wrong and live your life according to those very beliefs without compromising them for anyone. And as you continue on the path to living your purpose, don’t forget to mentally see yourself purpose living.

At this point of discovery you will start to identify your passion if you don’t already know. What is it that gives you a burning desire to fulfill or complete in life? If you are driven with passion to do certain things and you are really focused on these things as well as get great fulfillment and enjoyment in doing them, then you may have identified your purpose. However, most have not arrived to this place unless they understand the importance of relationships and serving others.

Along with developing relationships and serving others, you must also master the art of effective communications and setting boundaries. Learning how to effectively communicate in all of your relationships will enable you to successfully set boundaries. Setting boundaries will bring and give you the respect you need to have long, successful and lasting relationships. These same boundaries will also help you in accepting and respecting the boundaries of others.

Once you are confident in your relationships with boundaries, you are now ready to re-evaluate and establish your goals. A goal can be the same as a purpose, but try looking at goals as an outline of achievements to your path. Let goals be nothing more than categories and sub-categories of the outline in which you have created. With this same outline, now you can begin to road map your success of accomplishing these goals step by step.

Finally, finding your purpose in life is not a secret, nor is it a complicated task. It does however require a commitment and dedication on your part to transform yourself from the inside out from a purpose given into a life with a purpose that you’re living.
