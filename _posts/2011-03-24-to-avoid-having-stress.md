Stress is something that is in every ones day to day life. There are people that have a lot of stress, but at the same time, they do not let it get to them. Then also, you will find there are ‘other people’ who let nothing get to them at all. This is what keeps them from going crazy. Then there are people that worry so much that they get so stressed out that they go crazy. You could put your mind to these types of things to help your self out before something like this happens. There are many forms and types of help to avoid having stress at all.

There are a few different types of stress, depending on what you are stressed about. You could be stress about, work, money, or just any situation like that. There are many ways to handle things before you stress yourself out over it. Even if you worry a little bit about something, it could lead to stress. Then stress could lead to worse things than that. 

Stress is something that you would want to avoid as much as possible. It could lead to health risks, craziness, being put in the hospital, being ‘mean to people’, and other things related to that. Thinking positive will reduce the risk of being stressed out. Thinking negative is what causes you to lead to being stressed out. Worrying about things is also a leading cause of stress. Therefore, as long as you think positive you should be able to sit back, and enjoy life with it being stress free.
