A quality auto-responder will take care of a lot of tedious details and make it so you don&#8217;t have to spend all your time responding to your customers. The auto-responder makes it so you have more time to advertise and promote your website and to sell your products or services. Basically, you have more time for making money at home when you utilize a good auto-responder.
