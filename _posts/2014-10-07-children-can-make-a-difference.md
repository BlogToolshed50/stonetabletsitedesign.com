Here are a few ideas for how your family can promote and protect the human rights of all children around the world:

1. Write a letter: Families can write letters together to governments and opposition groups to speak out for children who face human rights abuses.

2. Be creative: Together you can make collages or do paintings about children&#8217;s human rights.

3. Wear it on your sleeve: Making your own t-shirts or hats with a social message is fun and easy with fabric paints.

4. Explore other cultures: Attend a multicultural event or cook a new dish together.

5. Make movies: If you have access to a video camera, encourage your kids to make their own videos about children&#8217;s human rights.

6. Start a family book club: If your kids are older, let them pick a book on a rights-related topic and discuss it as a family.

7. Bring it to school: Children can ask their teachers if they can do a special class activity for Universal Children&#8217;s Day.
