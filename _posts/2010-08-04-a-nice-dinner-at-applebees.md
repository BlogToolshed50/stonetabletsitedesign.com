Saturday evening I called up my best friend Barbara, and invited her out to dinner since I had not seen her in a few months, due to both our busy schedules. She was game and we decided to meet at Applebees around 7 o&#8217;clock that evening, since it is our favorite restaurant. I quickly got dressed, put the [cat](http://www.moderncat.net/) out for the night and set my [Adt Security](http://www.securitychoice.com/adt-wireless-home-security-system.html "Link to Adt Security") alarm as I walked out the door.

It did not take long to make the 5 mile drive out to Applebees, and it was great seeing Barbara again. The atmosphere inside Applebees that evening was so nice and inviting, and it only took moments for our hostess to seat us. The service was incredible as our server gave us ample time to look over the huge menu selection. The appetizer samplers that we ordered arrived at our table in less than 15 minutes and our server was very attentive.

Barbara and I had a great time at dinner that night, catching up on each other&#8217;s lives. We hated for the night to end, but we both keep very busy schedules. I know that we will get together again very soon, and I cannot wait. I am so fortunate to have a great friend like Barbara in my life.
