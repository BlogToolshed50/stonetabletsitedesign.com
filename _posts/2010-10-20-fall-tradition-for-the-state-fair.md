There are certain things that I do every fall with my family. That includes carving a pumpkin, taking them trick or treating and of course, taking them to the state fair. I always used to go with my parents when I was little and it was one of the things that I really looked forward to once the school year started back because I knew that I would be going to the fair sometime soon.

This year I wanted to go ahead adn buy tickets ahead of time just so we wouldn&#8217;t have to stand in line for tickets and use up some of our precious fair time on that. When I was doing that I ran across [www.getclearwirelessinternet.com](http://www.getclearwirelessinternet.com/high-speed-deals.html "Link to www.getclearwirelessinternet.com packages") and decided to change over our internet service over to that.

My favorite part of the [state fair](http://www.bakingjunkie.com/2010/09/eating-my-way-through-the-minnesota-state-fair/) is always when we go and see all of the exhibitions, including the live stock and all the food that has won the awards. Those pies always look so amazing even though they√ïve been sitting out for a couple of days.
