This is a guest post by Hannah Burnett

On a mission to find some great workout games for my Wii, I started searching my [wild blue broadband internet](http://get.wildblue.com/order.html). There were so many games available that it can be a bit overwhelming when you go into the store. I started out looking at the prices of the games. I was hoping to get 2 so I didn&#8217;t want to spend $50 on one game if I could help it. I found several that were $20-$30 so I started reading the reviews on these games.

The Biggest Loser game sounded great. I read over all the reviews and everyone had wonderful things to say about it. I love the show so I thought this could be a good one for me. I love Jillian so I also checked out her game. Her older Wii game got bad reviews, but the new version sounded amazing. I ended up ordering them both. Since I spent over $25, I was able to get free shipping also which helped.

Both games have arrived already. I have only tried The Biggest Loser one so far. I like that I can use Bob Harper or Jillian Michaels as my trainer and I can use my [direct tv internet](http://get.wildblue.com/) to track my results online. They also have challenges and weigh ins which is a lot of fun. I can&#8217;t wait to try the other game and see if I am as happy with the purchase as I am with this one.
