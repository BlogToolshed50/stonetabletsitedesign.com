Singing at church is something I’ve been doing for as long as I can remember. I haven’t always been the best singer, I know, but my heart is in it which is what I think matters the most.

My mom played the piano for church so I had to sit around and listen to the choir practice with her on Wednesday nights up until I was old enough to drive myself home from church. So naturally, I started singing just so I wouldn’t have to sit around and do nothing during those practices.

I thought I was always a decent singer, although I shied away from solos, until I saw a tape of our Christmas play from last year. I could hear myself singing [hymns](http://lexloiz.wordpress.com/2009/12/16/more-than-a-hymn-writer-charles-wesley-the-evangelist/) over everybody else when I thought that I was singing like normal. It made me think that I may need some [hearing devices](http://www.miracle-ear.com/) so I could hear myself sing better. Then my wife helped me look up [hearing aid costs](http://www.miracle-ear.com/choosehearingaid) and we found one for me.

I know I won’t exactly be offered any solos soon but I hope I’ll sound better than I did on that tape.
