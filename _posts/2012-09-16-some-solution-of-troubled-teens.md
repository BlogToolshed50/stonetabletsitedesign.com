Many parents find that dealing with troubled teens is becoming increasingly challenging in today’s world. If you have a troubled teen, there are specific steps you can take to help rectify the problem and have a happier life with (and for) your child.

When a teen continues to have severe problems, a change has to be made. Then you must to detect what’s reason behind that and how to solve the problems.

OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER: Living with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and having to deal with your fearful thoughts can be extremely difficult. It can be tough for people with OCD to have to experience obsessive thoughts that are intrusive, scary, and difficult to manage. From my interviews with various psychologists, I was told that a person should visualize a red stop sign in their mind when they encounter a fear provoking thought. When the negative thought comes, a person should think of a red stop sign which serves as a reminder to stop focusing on that thought and to think of something else.

A person should keep a small notebook of positive statements that makes teens feel good. Whenever they come across a positive and uplifting verse that makes them feel good, write it down in a small notebook. A person can then carry this notebook around in their pocket and whenever they feel anxious, they can read their notebook.

FACING THE FEAR AND ANXIETY OF THE UNKNOWN: All most everybody worries about what will happen in the future. The prospect of not knowing if something good or bad will happen to you in the near future can produce a lot of fear and anxiety. Instead of worrying about how you will get through the rest of the week or coming month, try to focus on today. Each day can provide us with different opportunities to learn new things and that includes learning how to deal with your problems. When the time comes, hopefully you will have learned the skills to deal with your situation.

MANAGING YOUR DEPRESSION: Some people have a difficult time in managing their depression. Sometimes, their depression and fears can get best of them. One of the ways to manage depression is to challenge your negative thinking with positive statements and realistic thinking. When encountering thoughts that make your fearful or depressed, challenge those thoughts by asking yourself questions that will maintain objectivity and common sense.

For example, you’re afraid that if you do not get that job promotion then you will be stuck at your job forever. This depresses you; however your thinking in this situation is unrealistic.

Crafts can be a great way to meet people. Doing something that you like to do will make you happy and will increase your chances of making friends.

Remember that sometimes our worrying and fears can make the problem even worse. Take things in stride and try not focus too much on the problem. In time, you will find the ways to overcome your phobia.
