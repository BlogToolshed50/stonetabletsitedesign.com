Guest post written by Shelly Carlton

When I was pregnant with my first kid, people kept telling me that I should prepare myself for motherhood because anything and everything can happen with kids. I expected that, but still at the same time didn&#8217;t know just how much that would be true. Now I&#8217;m a mom of three and I stay super busy.

The kids are always getting into stuff around the house no matter how much I try to kid proof the house and all of our stuff. Last week our middle one, Lucy, who&#8217;s 5 got into a stash of [Markers](http://penelopeloveslists.com/organize/how-penelope-keeps-herself-sane-when-the-kids-are-out-of-school/ "Click here for markers deal") that she found in our office closet. Then she colored with them adn drew pictures all over our kitchen, including on teh front of our white fridge and on my white countertops. So after that I found [www.homeproimprovement.com](http://homeproimprovement.com/) and called them up and are going to get them to remodel our kitchen. But I think that I&#8217;m going to get dark grey or black countertops and black appliances that will be more coloring proof. Plus, I went out and bought some fo those markers that only work on a special kind of paper. Hopefully that will keep her occupied.
