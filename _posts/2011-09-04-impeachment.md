Impeachment is nothing but ringing &#8220;no confidence&#8221; against the head of a state. The parliamentarians together can bring such motion against the president to oust him, form the position. When the parliament feels that the continuation of the present president is no more capable of guiding the country towards prosperity then such decision is taken to remove him from the position. Such move can be initiated if only the ruling party in the parliament is having absolute majority. In the constitution of any country provision is made for such impeachment motion when needed arises.
