Written by my friend Edward Mayer

My boyfriend and I have been living together for a little over 5 years and he is always trying to get me to go camping with him. I never agree to go only because of so many horror stories I have heard about what happens to people while they are camping. I&#8217;ve heard of bears or wolves eating and tearing up campsites and people getting lost or getting seriously injured.

Well, my boyfriend gathered up about 6 couples that we are friends with to convince me to go this year and it worked. Before we left, we packed up all of our camping essentials and made sure to set our home security alarm from [Besthomesecurity.com](http://www.besthomesecurity.com/ "Click here for Besthomesecurity.com deal"). We headed to a campsite in the state that was recommended to us by one of our friends.

I must admit, camping was nothing like I pictured it to be. It was so relaxing and quiet and so much fun! We went hiking, fishing and there was a local business offering [kayaking](http://paddlingtravelers.blogspot.com/) lessons. At night, we all pitched in to start a bonfire and roast some marshmallows. We told each other some horror stories, but it was all in good fun and nothing like I imagined.

Honestly, I would recommend camping to anyone. It is such a fun and mellow experience that involves being stress free with nothing really to worry about.
