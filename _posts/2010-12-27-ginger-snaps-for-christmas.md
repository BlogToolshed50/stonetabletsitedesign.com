Every year I like to concentrate on making one kind of Christmas cookie. I started doing this like a decade ago after my kids wanted me to make like five different kinds of Christmas cookies. I told them that from then on out I&#8217;d only make one a year and I would let them choose which kinds. Well, now both of my kids are grown up so they don&#8217;t really care so much what kind of cookie I fix each Christmas. Therefore I get to choose them, which I think is fair because I make them.

I knew that I wanted to do some kind of ginger tasting cookie that wasn&#8217;t a gingerbread man though. So I went online with our [ClearwireInternet](http://www.clearwireinternet.com/what_is_clearwire_internet.html) to try and find a different kind of gingerbread cookie recipe.

I decided to make some [ginger Christmas cookies](http://www.kitchenparade.com/2009/12/chocolate-ginger-crinkle-cookies.php "Link to ginger Christmas cookies deal") that I guess you could call snaps. I&#8217;d never made any like that before and they&#8217;re pretty tasty. Also, they&#8217;re a nice break from just regular old sugar or chocolate cookies.
