Nowadays, most of the people realize that there is a direct link between lifestyle and health. In a developed world though some people can afford to make choices about food, they fail to eat a healthy diet. Those people who eat a lot of fatty foods often develop high cholesterol that makes them susceptible to heart disease. On the other hand, in the poorer countries, children who do not have enough to eat develop diseases which are directly related to lack of proteins and other nutrients.

Many people cannot afford to buy the daily mix of proteins, carbohydrates, fresh fruits and vegetables, so the nutritional benefits of their diet are limited. There are significant differences between nutrient intake in different places even in the developed world. People in the Mediterranean countries, such as Greece and Italy, benefit from diet of fresh food and olive oil, while Japanese get protein from a heavy diet of fish.

Social development through education and literacy usually leads to improved health due to better awareness about nutrition, health and hygiene. The poverty can be broken by economic development which means better employment, housing and availability of food. Development can offer health benefits for the more deprived sections of societies, but in the poorer countries, the benefits reach rarely to people in need due to problems of debt, distribution and lack of communications and transportation.
