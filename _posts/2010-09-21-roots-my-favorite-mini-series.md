There is no greater mini series in the history of television than Roots. Based on the novel by Alex Haley, Roots is a mini series whose themes and cultural significance still hold weight today. Like most historical dramas, Roots and other vintage mini series are shown on classic networks that you can only watch on [satellite TV packages in California](http://www.bestchoicetv.com/satellite-tv/ca/).

A tale of the struggles of a Mandinka warrior turned slave by the name of [Kunta Kinte](http://kunta-kinte007.blogspot.com/ "Kunta Kinte packages"), Roots is by far my favorite mini series. It tells the dark tale of America as it scoured the earth for the cheapest kind of labor, the kind you don&#8217;t have to pay. They called these people slaves, and it was one of the most despicable and reprehensible acts ever wrought by man. Yet Roots, told from the perspective of Kunta Kinte and two subsequent generations of children, Roots exemplifies not only the physical injustice but the cultural one as well, showing how many slaves were stripped of their humanity and rich heritage by the avarice of their owners. They lost their names, they lost their souls.

The effects from this period still ripple in society today. It is important for all young children to understand the injustices of the past as they help to write our nation&#8217;s future. Roots is both a riveting tale and an educational piece that will help people understand that history is not to be forgotten, and the struggles of those pioneers involved should be forever enshrined in the fabric of our memory.
