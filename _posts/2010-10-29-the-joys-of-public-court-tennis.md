Guest post written by Derick Burks

I play tennis with my friend and neighbor Ted. We play at a park near our homes, Ellsworth Allen Park which is run by the Town of Oyster Bay in Long Island, New York. Even though this is a town park and the courts are used constantly they are well cared for. The two of us can wander over to the park as the mood strikes us, the courts are lighted so we can even do this at night. To me this is part of the beauty of tennis, that we can play a quick but serious game without dragging along a ton of equipment, that a game of tennis played on a court in a modest public park is really no different than one played at a fancy country club. The courts are so close to our homes that we have run over during family [dinners](http://dinnersintheblog.blogspot.com/ "dinners offers") for a quick game. There was even a time that Ted forgot to set his home alarm system from [HOMEALARMEXPERT](http://www.homealarmexpert.com/adt-alarm-system-benefits.html "HOMEALARMEXPERT offers"), ran home to make sure it was properly set and came back and continued the game. We have had some great times on those courts. The two of us are very evenly matched and as we have played so often we know how to exploit each others weaknesses.This of course has led to a continued “arms race”, each of use buying newer more improved rackets in the hope of a bit of an edge. Hey, we have no country club fees, we can invest in our equipment.
