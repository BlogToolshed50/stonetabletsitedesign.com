wning your own business is a dream come true. The freedom of being your own boss and succeeding to the best of your ability are facts of life for the small business owner. Sure, there&#8217;s more stress than what you probably imagined when you were creating your grand plans, but with a little strategy and planning you can overcome any tough spot you get in. There are 7 tactics developed by successful marketers that are sure to make your business as successful as theirs.

1. Create A One of a Kind Selling Point
  
If you want to stand out from the crowd, create a unique selling proposition that stresses the benefits the customers will receive from doing business with you. Will they get faster service? Go ahead and dramatize it, but keep the customer at the focus&#8230;&#8221;Get free overnight delivery!&#8221; Hey, it tells the customer&#8230;you get quick service and a discount on shipping. Two definite benefits in one statement.

Why should someone buy from you and not your competitor? I hate to deal a blow to your ego, but it really has nothing to do with you , your product, or your service. Yeah, its a little self-centered, but customers are attracted by offers that point out the things that benefit THEM.

Don&#8217;t go out on a limb to create new products and services to get attention. Just, add a special benefit to the ones you already have&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s quicker service. The most effective things to emphasize are benefits that your competition cannot or is not willing to give. 

2. Use Testimonials
  
Hey, we all know that business owners think their product or services are the best thing going, but it&#8217;s what the current customers think about it that really matters to your prospective customers. They&#8217;re the ones who see things from their point of view&#8230; what they have to say about the business has an impact.

Testimonials play an important part in advertising &#8211; especially for small businesses. Yeah, big businesses with well-known names don&#8217;t have to worry about it, but small companies can use testimonials as marketing tools to build credibility.

Think about it&#8230;how else can we gain credibility than by creating a group of satisfied customers and shouting what they have to say? Let&#8217;s look at some ways we can make testimonials an effective part of our marketing campaigns.
