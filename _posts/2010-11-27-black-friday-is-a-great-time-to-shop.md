Black Friday is renowned for being a terrible time to go shopping. There are huge lines, angry customers, and even angrier shopkeepers. People will still continue to go shopping the day after Thanksgiving, even though they know that craziness will be prevalent.

When I go shopping on Black Friday I always make sure to set my [AllHomeSecurity](http://www.allhomesecurity.com/adt-security/New-York/R/) home security system. There are many people who will take Black Friday and break into houses of people they know will be shopping. I often go around the major shops and malls here in Anchorage to shop on this day. The malls are the better place to go as there are more stores and a variety of items to buy.

When I go shopping on Black Friday I go with my fianc√©, or my family. We normally do not really but that much as the lines are insanely long, but looking around at all the items is quite fun. I enjoy pricing things for Christmas and future holidays, as well as seeing what new types of items are coming in. There is much more fun to be had on this day then just shopping.

Places that I commonly make it a point to avoid on Black Friday are [grocery](http://www.afullcup.com/Grocery-Coupon-Blog/ "grocery specials") stores, big franchise shopping stores, and warehouses. These places are not only completely packed with people, they are also where many angry customers enjoy taking their hostility out on everyone.
