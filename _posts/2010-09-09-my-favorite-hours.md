This guest post from Werner Rogers

I have been going to the movie theatre for as long as I can remember. I fondly recall Saturday afternoons in the cool darkness, with a hero based serial and the [News Reel](http://emol.org/movies/newsreels/).

Later on it was Friday night or Sunday afternoon dates at the movies. Gone, by then, were the serials and the March of Time news reel, replaced with lots of movie trailers. Later advertisements were added.

At my age, I have adopted a routine which fits my lifestyle and pocketbook. I still go once a week. I have let go of the decision making process. I see the movie which tops the weekend box office chart. It makes no difference what the movie is. I go. If there is a repeat, I see what is second.

On Mondays, I choose a showing at the local multiplex with matinee pricing. I go by myself. I have learned not everyone is willing to see the top movie of the week without regard to its genre or appeal.

At the prescribed time, I set my [homes alarm](http://www.securitychoice.com/ "homes alarm offers") system, get in my car and go. I arrive a bit early so I can find a good seat. I, then, sit back and enjoy.

They are some of my favorite hours of the week.
