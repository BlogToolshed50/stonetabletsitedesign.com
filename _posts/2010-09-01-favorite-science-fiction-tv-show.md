My favorite Science Fiction TV show of all time is The Twilight Zone. Twilight Zone is a classic show that in a half hours time deals with a fictional scenario that usually ends in dismay. During it&#8217;s time the Twilight Zone was a very popular show for which many an actor wanted to be part of.

Hosted by Rod Serling each week you would be transported to a different time and space and it would seem for that half hour time would stop and you would be engrossed in the show. I enjoyed watching the show back then and I enjoy watching it now on my satellite tv. Once I learned [how much does DirecTV cost](http://cannonsatellite.com/programming_pkgs.cfm) I ordered it!

The Twilight Zone, although had been immitated and reproduced through the years can never be replaced by the original. It&#8217;s timeless and no matter how much time passes it is being discovered by a new audience every time it is shown on TV. I especially love to watch the [Twilight Zone](http://twilightzonewor.9.forumer.com/index.php?act=idx) marathons which are shown usually on New Years Eve and again on the 4th of July. If I&#8217;m not home during those holiday&#8217;s I make sure to set my VCR to program them. This way I don&#8217;t miss a minute.

I always have this pet peeve that every year I have to watch teh maration until I see my favorite episodes. Fortunately I have never missed one yet.
