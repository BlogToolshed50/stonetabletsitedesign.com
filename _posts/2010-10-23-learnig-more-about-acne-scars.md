Macules and Scars:
  
Before I jump into the topic of scars, I need to clarify the difference between Macules and Scars. Macules may look like scars, but they are not scars in the sense that a permanent change has occurred. Macules are essentially the final stage of most inflamed acne lesions. They are normally flat, reddish spots that can remain for up to 8 months. But the difference between a Macule and a scar is that a Macule will end up disappearing completely whereas a scar will remain for years or indefinitely.

As for scars, this can also vary from person to person. With some individuals, scars may remain for a lifetime without change but with others, their skin will undergo a form of remodeling that will eventually diminish the scar.

Another factor that needs to be evaluated is the human element of scarring. People simply have different feelings about acne scars. Those who are distressed about their acne scars are much more likely to actively seek out treatment to moderate or remove the scar than those who are more indifferent about the scars.

Cause of Scars:
  
Let us first gain a better understanding of acne scars by first determining the cause of scars. A scar is a mark left in the skin by the healing of a wound or surgical incision in which the normal functional tissue (skin) is replaced by connective tissue (scar). In the case of acne, the lesion is caused by the bodyâ€™s inflammatory response to sebum, bacteria and dead cells that are trapped in the plugged sebaceous follicle.

When your skin tissue has suffered a lesion of some sorts, your body will attempt to heal the injured site. It does so by increasing the white blood cells in the area along with an array of inflammatory molecules whose function is to repair the damaged tissue and fight infection. In the end, the repair job can be messy, and the site of the lesion is now filled with fibrous scar tissue or eroded tissue. As for the inflammatory molecules and white blood cells, they can remain at the acne lesion for days and even weeks.

Take note of the fact that not everyone functions in the same way, and this holds true with our skin as well. Some people are simply more prone to scarring than others.
