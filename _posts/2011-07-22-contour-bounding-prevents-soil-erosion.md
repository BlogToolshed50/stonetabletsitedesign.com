Contour Bounding is a cultural practice followed in the hilly area to prevent soil erosion. In the sloppy areas where the gradient is beyond a limit the soil erosion occurs due to the wind velocity and water flow. Such contours are erected with the help of revetments also out of stones. The revetments not only prevent the soil erosion, but also stores the silt hat is washed through the rain water which enriches the soil with natural manure.
