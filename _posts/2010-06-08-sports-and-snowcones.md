Thanks to Mick Taylor for the guest post.

The summertime is one of the best times of the year for outdoor activities, which is why my favorite summer activities are all outdoors. I enjoy playing sports with friends such as tennis, volleyball, and baseball, as well as going swimming and taking vacations to the beach.

The reason why the summertime is perfect for outdoor activities is the sunny weather the time period provides, and the ample temperature range. While it does sometimes get a little on the warmer side, I always have my [direct tv](http://www.direct.tv/)satellite tv accompanied with a cool glass of lemonade inside my air conditioned home.

The summertime is great for playing outdoor sports for the ample weather, and whenever the games get to heated there is always snowcones to have after games and events. During the sports I like to also stay hydrated with the various collection of sports drinks which have become a part of my summer.

Aside from sports, going to the [beach](http://beach.freedomblogging.com/) and swimming in the pools and ocean that the coastal region provides is also a favorite summer activity of mine. The beach is great for the open atmosphere it provides in combination of a people friendly setting. A great part of my beach vacations is also shell collecting in the early mornings when there are not that many people walking about.

Overall my favorite summer activities are all outdoors for the one reason of perfect weather and longer daylight hours.
