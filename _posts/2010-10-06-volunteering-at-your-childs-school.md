I love to volunteer at my daughter&#8217;s school. I love to spend time with her, and she loves for me to visit. Before I come visit I am sure to set my home alarm system that I found on [HomeAlarmExpert.com](http://www.homealarmexpert.com/alarms-for-the-home/ "Click here for HomeAlarmExpert.com page"). I often help the kids with there daily assignments, we read, answer questions, and do [art](http://fallonandrosof.blogspot.com/) projects. I love to visit so I can see how adjusted she is, and to keep up with what she is learning.

I often read books to the class which is great! I love to see the faces of the kids light up. I alsways leave feeling as though I have made a great accomplishment for that day. The kids always seem to look forward to visit from parents, even if they are not there own. I look forward to voulunteering at my daughter&#8217;s school every year until she gets embarassed of me bein there. Until then I will continue to come to school to show my support for my daughter, her school, and the teachers that work there.

In order for kids to succeed in school we have to show them that we care about the things that they are doing, and we have to continue to encourage them, on a regular basis.
