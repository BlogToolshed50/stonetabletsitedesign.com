When it comes to my favorite show on a premium channel I have to give kudos to [Entourage](http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/blogs/entourage.htm) the hit comedy drama series that is shown on HBO. Even though this show has been on television for almost 6 years it seems just as hard hitting, inspired and interesting as it did during its debut season in 2004.

For those who may not be familiar with Entourage I can tell you that it focuses on the life of a character named Vincent Chase. Vincent is a top young Hollywood star and now he and his “homies” from Queens, NY have to find their way around the unforgiving streets of Tinsel Town.

The basis for the show was inspired by events in Mark Wahlberg’s own life. Now he brings his early adventures to television audiences with no punches pulled. Wahlberg and fellow Hollywood insider Stephen Levison are the executive producers of Entourage.

This HBO show has everything going for it including the kitchen sink and this why I always make a date watch HBO and Entourage on cable TV each week. [how much does cable tv cost](http://www.tvbydirect.com/nfl-sunday-ticket-deal/)? You might ask, call your local retailer to find out and get HBO asap and watch Entourage. Few shows have dared to be as creative and innovative which is why this series has had such a spectacular run thus far.
