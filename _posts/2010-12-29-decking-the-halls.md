Guest post of the week by Brittany Booker

When I was a kid, the [Christmas decorations](http://www.acadiawreath.com/blog/blog.html) never made it out of the attic until December 15th. This was more of a ritual than a process for the whole family. You were considered a nut if you put any bit of pine or garland out before Thanksgiving.

Wow, how everything has changed. My neighbors are stringing lights before the Canadian Thanksgiving, and the local radio stations are playing Christmas songs in mid-November.

I still embrace some of my family traditions. I bake cookies before we decorate, the special glass ornament goes on the tree last. But some things are very different.

Television was off limits while we trimmed our tree. We played Christmas albums, we ate cookies and drank hot chocolate.

But you know, Mom wasn&#8217;t a hockey fan. One of the best gifts ever is [direct tv offers](http://www.cabletelevision.net/cable-tv/) and a good hockey game after decking the halls.

We have our own rituals now which is as it should be. My family may not do things exactly like we did when I was a child, but the most important element is there. We celebrate the season and enjoy each other.
