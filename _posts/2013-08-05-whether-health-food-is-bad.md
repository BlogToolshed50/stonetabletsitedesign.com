Excess fiber is found to cause bloating, gas and abdominal cramps apart from reducing the absorption of minerals like iron, zinc, magnesium. This leads to the deficiency of these vital needs for the health resulting in the body to be prone to various diseases. As such, overdose of any health food is found to set its own problem.

The research done at various Health Institutes indicate that the popular belief of eating more amount of carrots and papaya is wrong. The body converts the beta carotene into vitamin A, from these fruits, but absorbs the needed quantity only out of the whole thing converted. The rest of the beta carotene A remains in the system affecting the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. This condition is called &#8220;Carotnemia&#8221;.
