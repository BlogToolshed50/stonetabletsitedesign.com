Most people believe cancers come out of nowhere. Cancers develop if you follow an unhealthy diet full of cancer causing food over a prolonged period of time. Certain food consists of a lot of cancer promoting substances called carcinogens. In this article, we shall explore 3 common types of carcinogens present in an average person&#8217;s diet, what food we should eat and shouldn&#8217;t eat to prevent cancer.

Acrylamide and Food: What It Means For You

Acrylamide has been used in industries that specialize in the manufacturing of food packaging, creation of plastic and treatment of contaminated water. Experts recently found traces of acrylamide in food that was cooked with high temperature cooking methods such as roasting, microwaving, frying and baking. Acrylamide has been confirmed to cause cancer in animals but no clear cut link has been found to indicate this happens in human beings even though acrylamide is extremely toxic for our bodies. French fries top the charts of food that contain the highest levels of acrylamide, followed by certain brands of potato chips, breakfast cereals, cookies, brewed coffee and toast bread according to the US FDA/CFSAN 2006 Exposure Assessment for Acrylamide.

Sodium Nitrate: Why You Should Avoid It

Sodium nitrate is a standard food additive of processed meat. It is used to preserve the reddish color of meat to make it look more delicious to eat at the neglection of your health. Sodium nitrate on it&#8217;s own is relatively harmless but it changes into a carcinogenic substance called nitrosamine during the digestion process, thus promoting the development of cancer cells. Sodium nitrate can be found in processed meat like sausages, bacon, lunch meat, bologna, ham and pepperoni.

Trans Fat: The Worst Fat In The World

Trans fat or trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are the most unhealthy kind of fat you can consume. The problem with trans fat is because it was transformed from it&#8217;s vegetable oil form to a semi-solid state through the use of hydrogen. Some companies do this to improve flavor stability, to extend the shelf life of their products and to save money. Due to it&#8217;s processed nature, it is considered unnatural in our bodies and it is very tough to digest, therefore it easily clogs our arteries if we don&#8217;t exercise often. What&#8217;s worse, trans fat promotes the development of bad cholesterol and reduces the levels of good cholesterol, increasing your risk of heart disease. Trans fat can be found in hydrogenated oils, food with vegetable shortening, pastries, commercially deep-fried food and partially hydrogenated oils.

Foods That Will Help You Lay Off Cancer

It is ideal for all of us to restrict or eliminate our consumption of processed food that contain the 3 carcinogens above and other unnecessary substances such as alcohol, salt, sugar and tobacco. However, it is not easy for people to choose to have a healthy body over the enjoyment of good food. The choice is up to you to decide which is more important to you. At the minimum, consume as much organic vegetables, fruit and meat as you can. Having a diet made of antioxidants, nutrients and fiber from raw vegetables and fruit should help you steer clear from cancer. A simple rule you can follow is to simply eat the things God created for us to eat and avoid anything created by man.
