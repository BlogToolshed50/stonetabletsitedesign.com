A team in general comprises of a set of people who will have different thinking and are formed into a group for better understanding. The most important thing a team should contain is common perceptive and belief. When we work at a place we automatically becomes part of their team. As a part of a team every one works to achieve a common goal, which can be attained only when all members of the team have better understanding towards their goal.

A better outcome can be seen when a team work is there. The main success of a team is seen when there is equal communication, more motivation and appraisal from higher authority people, sharing of responsibilities etc makes the team members more exciting towards their work. People coming and working together is a big advantage to any organization, because a home can be built up only when sticks are joined together.

Everyone in the team will have some kind of specialty and talent which would lead to move up the results. This will help to bring out the talent of the people and certainly their self confidence will increase with better morale. This will over shadow the limitations, shyness of anyone and will also make them to work more innovative.

Every person should be given some authority and he will be only accountable for the same. There should be a clear understanding of what has to be done, by whom and by what time. Time is always an important factor for any work to be done. Trusting each other should be developed or else it will result up in problems. Openness of saying or talking to seniors should also be motivated for better clarity. This can be done by conducting some activities and events. Try different programs so that members get sometime to know about each other and so that working would become easier.

The goal can be set by team leader but its achievement can be had only by team. Goal setting is done but its accomplishment should be planned by all members of the team. Every one should be allotted work according to their capacities or small goals can be set up and teammates can be thought in order to ascertain it. Everyone should so well-binded in team so that they form the bonding relationship. This will certainly help them to improve their morale and more perfection will be seen in their work.

A team can be better bonded when there is no I or ME only WE is their. The team leader or members should appraise at times for a better job done. The inter personal problem should be solved at once rather then leaving them to grow. Any difficulty can be easily solved by giving positive steps to overcome it and members should feel free to discuss with leader or co members.

A satisfied employee is an asset towards future of a company who will yield best results.
  
A person should be well recognized for the excellent goal achievement and can make him better by authority and responsibility sharing. A team success depends surely on its members who form and perform as a team.
