While the drama of The Thorn Birds was one of the most amazing mini-series to be broadcast on satellite from [CannonSatellite.com](http://cannonsatellite.com/programming_pkgs.cfm), it left us with an unanswered question that plagued our curiosity; what took place in the large gap of time that [The Thorn Birds](http://medievalbookworm.com/reviews/review-the-thorn-birds-colleen-mccullough/) did not cover? While The Thorn Birds did span over 50 years of history in the lives of Father Ralph Debrickasar and the Cleary family, there was a large gap of time from the birth of Meggie Cleary&#8217;s second child, to seeing both children as adults that we never had the opportunity to see.

The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years, covers an important section of this time, as well as answering many questions about Meggie and her children. The story begins when Meggie&#8217;s children are between the ages of 10 and 12 years old. Justine, Meggie&#8217;s daughter, is the oldest. However, while Justine dearly loves her younger brother Dane dearly, she feels the lack of bonding and affection from her mother. This sets the stage for the return of Luke, Meggies opportunistic husband. This explains the gap of time and so much more of the characters of Dane and Justine. As we see how Luke ignores Justine because she is a girl, and Meggie neglects her emotionally, we come to understand better what makes Justine tick. All of these elements bring the story together.
