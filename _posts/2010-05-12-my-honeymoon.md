This is a guest post by my friend Candice Treller

When my husband and I got married, I left the trip planning up to him. He told me he has something amazing planned. I was very excited. First, we had to get married. The wedding was amazing. Everything went exactly as planned. After the wedding, we put our [home monitoring systems](http://www.securitychoice.com/) to work and set out for our trip. I had no idea where we were going. We just started driving north. We drove, we drove and we drove. We stopped for the night at a filthy hotel, but I figured that it was okay, we were saving money and it didn&#8217;t matter, we were married! The next day we drove another couple of hours and finally reached our destination. It was a cute little camp ground with cabins that we were staying. Rather, with a cabin that we were supposed to be staying at. However, our reservations got messed up and we ended up sleeping on the ground. I thought it was going to be such a horrible honeymoon. It got started off to such a bad start. But, the next night, our cabin was ready for us and we got much better accommodations than planned. The next day, everything got worse. It was raining, muddy, and just nasty. I thought our trip was ruined. But, my husband saved the day! He found some really neat antique shops for us to go to and we spent the day looking at all the neat things the shops had to offer. After that, it was smooth sailing. We got to spend some really good time together and made memories that we will never forget.
