One thing that I have tried to do this year is keep up with the Atlanta Braves. I have been to a few games so far and I still have tickets for one more this season. It is about a five hour drive to Turner Field from where I live, so when I am not able to take time to go to Atlanta, I catch the games on satellite TV from [www.CannonSatellite.com](http://cannonsatellite.com/programming_pkgs.cfm "www.CannonSatellite.com specials"). I decided it was going to be important to me to make sure to take in a few games this season when I found out that it was going to be the last year at the helm for legendary manager [Bobby Cox](http://www.nationalsdailynews.com/columnists/post.cfm?blog=hendo&id=721&story=nationals-to-honor-bobby-cox-before-sundays-game&s=rss). My spouse also happens to be an avid baseball fan, so, being our first year together close enough to the Braves, I thought it would be nice for the two of us to take a few weekends to catch a game.

The experience at Turner Field is unlike any other ballpark I have been to. We ordered our tickets online, so getting in was a breeze. As you walk up a small flight of stairs to approach the field itself, each step reveals a little bit more of the stadium until you can see it in full view at the top of the stairs. It is absolutely gorgeous. The concession prices are fairly reasonable. After admiring the view, we took our seats. Concession prices were pretty fair for the ballpark and they offer a pretty good burger. In our first trip, we got to see rookie phenom Jason Heyward hit a line drive into right field which drove in a run, so that was probably the highlight of the game. We still have one more game to attend, the Bobby Cox Tribute game against the Phillies, and we know it&#8217;ll be a great time.
