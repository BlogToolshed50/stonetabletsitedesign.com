Thanks to guest blogger Hannah Phillson for the post.

Maine is a great location for a holiday no matter where you are coming from. As for me, I prefer the rural areas of the state. The urban areas remind me of New York City. Before heading to Maine every summer, I set the [Viginia adt alarm](http://www.securitychoice.com/adt-home-security/Virginia/) and concentrate on the trip up to Maine.

This summer the destination is central Maine, the Skowhegan area to be specific. The small town of Canaan, lies 12 miles from the small city of Skowhegan. This is the type of town one can easily call home if give the chance. It is quiet and filled with friendly people. The cost of living might not be the lowest compared to other rural areas of America, but the scenery is beautiful and unforgettable.

I can concentrate on putting [New York City](http://www.nycbloggers.com/) behind for some time because my home is protected and anything that should be hidden has been put away. I wonder if I will remember where I put the valuables when I return home. I will worry about that later, knowing everything is safe and a great vacation lies ahead of me.
