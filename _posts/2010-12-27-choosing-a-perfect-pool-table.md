Pool tables come in 7-, 8-, or 9-foot lengths. The size you choose is a matter of available space, but keep in mind that tournament length is 9 feet. If you’re a stickler for authenticity, go for the tournament length.

The pool table is comprised of a body, a bed, side cushions, a felt-covered surface, and pockets. The body can be made of wood, laminates, wood veneer, plastics, and sometimes metal. It can be simple and mass-produced, or it can be luxurious and ornately decorated. Some models will blow your mind with their unconventional styles!

The pool table bed is usually made of one piece of slate; this is the only type of surface that serious pool players will accept. Cheaper beds are available if you aren’t a stickler for sure lines and straight shots.

Cloth or felt color can come in a variety of colors. Sometimes a manufacturer or dealer will let you customize the color of your table when you buy it.

Brunswick is a leader in the industry. Brunswick offers over 34 models of pool tables, each uniquely distinct in overall style and flourish. Choose the Artisan model for sleek lines, the Green-briar for a statelier centerpiece to your game room, or the Manhattan for a wood and stainless steel paean to the urban lifestyle! The Contender series some more affordable models, plus a few extra game tables like air hockey and football. There you can “build your own table” by selecting a style, a cloth color, and even a size (7, 8, or 9 feet.) You can also learn more about the contemporary world of billiards.
