Guest post written by Kathy Lowe

A combination of student loans from undergraduate and grad school and some big credit card bills have been hanging over my head for quite a while now. But I&#8217;m sick of worrying about it on the back burner and making the minimum payments on those bills. So I made a New Year&#8217;s resolution to pay off as much of those this year as I can within my budget.

So many of my friends my age have that problem too and I can&#8217;t even imagine how long some of my friends who are doctors are going to take to pay off their loans. I&#8217;ve been doing my research on how to pay all of these off with my [clear wireless internet](http://www.clearwirelessinternet.com/compare-wimax-lte.html "Link to clear wireless internet specials") and have even worked out a payment plan by the end of the year to pay them off. I&#8217;m sure that if emergencies come up, I won&#8217;t be able to stick to it, but I&#8217;m hoping to.

I know that this is a [tough personal finance resolution](http://www.consumerismcommentary.com/people-fail-at-financial-new-years-resolutions/), but it will feel really great in 2012 to not worry about student loan payments any more.
