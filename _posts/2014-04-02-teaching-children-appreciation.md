The holidays are approaching and children are busy getting their lists of gifts ready, as parents prepare to go shopping. Wonderful as the holidays are, it is a time to wonder how much our children appreciate what they have (and soon will get), how much they take things for granted and how often they share or provide charity for those less fortunate during the holidays.

What can you do so children appreciate what they have and not take things for granted? Start by taking a look at yourself as a parent. Check with yourself the reasons you buy the children things and how much you buy. For example, do you buy to reward good grades or behavior? Because it was pretty? Guilt of coming home too late? Guilt of being divorced and not seeing the children often enough? Because everyone else has it? It is the latest trend? Next, how do the children react when you give them the gift? Do they spend time playing with it? Do they put it on the side? Do they jump for joy? Do they even say thank you? The less they react, the less they play with it and how soon they get bored gives you a clue that you probably are buying too much. Finally, are you thanked and appreciated for the gesture? Teach the children to differentiate between their needs and wants. For example, their needs include shelter, food, education, clothing etc., and their wants are basically everything else.

What can you do during the holiday season? The first step is to teach children appreciation for the things that they already have. One way of doing this is taking out all the toys, games, music, DVD, stuffed animals, Nintendo, etc. that you have at home and place them in one room. I can almost guarantee that you as well as they will be shocked and surprised at how many things you have accumulated through the years. Then, sort them out in priorities. For example, which ones are necessary and they need; which ones they play more often with; which ones are really meaningful for the home; the incomplete and broken ones (that we mean to clean out and always forget) and last but not least, the ones they donâ€™t use anymore (or might even have forgotten you had). Finally, come up with a list of charities to donate some of these things to. Pick out the charities with the children; let it be food, books, clothing, toys centers, hospitals, shelters, etc. Make it a joint process. This will help create a social conscience in the children, an awareness of their community and a sense of belonging. By doing this process, you have not only helped others less fortunate, but also your children in a process of growing up.
