It breaks my heart to leave my [poodle](http://www.bestbullysticks.com/blog/3/best-bully-sticks-spotlight-on-a-breed-yorkie-poodle-yorkie-poo/ "Click here for poodle offers") Bentley at home for extended periods of time, but I can’t exactly bring him with me to work at the office. So, of course I leave him at home during the day and let him roam freely around my apartment. I live by myself so I don’t have to worry about any roommates minding him roaming around.

A few weeks ago I noticed that it was abnormally hot when I came home from work to left Bentley and it ends up that it was unfortunately what I expected. My air conditioning was broken. I didn’t want to wait around long to get a new unit so I found [www.homeproimprovement.com](http://www.homeproimprovement.com/sears-home-improvement/) and looked at units on there. I had a service person come out and install a unit so I didn’t have to worry about finding someone to babysit or [board](http://adoptshelterdogs.com/dogadoptiontips/shelter-dog-adoption-tip-4-veterinarian-grooming-and-boarding "board deal"). Bentley for very long.

Now I don’t have to worry about Bentley having a heat stroke or health problems in the middle of summer because that apartment can get so hot if the air conditioning isn’t running.
