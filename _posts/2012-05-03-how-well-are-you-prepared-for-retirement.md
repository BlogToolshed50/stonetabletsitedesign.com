How much have you thought about retirement? If you are like a lot of American’s, it is not foremost in your mind, but it should be important to you. Here are a few things that you can do to help you know where you stand:

• Prepare an overview of your expenses-calculate everything that you pay out from your groceries to your utilities. Find out what it currently costs you to live.

• Look into your future-some of your costs may increase, but you will have other costs that will decrease in the future. Try to be specific about what it will cost you to live. Don’t forget to factor in inflation.

• Calculate long-If you retire at age 65, you average life expectancy is another 20 years, but what if you live another 30. You had better plan for the fact that you might beat the odds.

• Know where you are-calculate where you stand know and approximate what you will be able to save in the future. Be conservative in your estimations. Don’t forget about pensions, 401K and Social Security.

• Make adjustments-if you have done your calculation and find that you are falling short of where you need to be, make the necessary adjustments so that you will be prepared. You may need to save more, delay retirement, work part time or reduce your spending so you are prepared for retirement.

It is no secret that the soon you start preparing for retirement, the better off you will be. It is also important to know where you stand at any given time. You should evaluate where you are in the retirement saving process and where you want to be and what your time line is. This is something you should do regularly to avoid surprises.
