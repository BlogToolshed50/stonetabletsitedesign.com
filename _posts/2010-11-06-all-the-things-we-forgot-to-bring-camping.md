Okay, let me warn you up front. This could get messy. But I&#8217;m only here to warn you.

The last time my family went camping way up north in Maine&#8211;in a town called The Forks&#8211;we remembered the bacon. We remembered the potato chips. We remembered to board the dog and turn on our home security alarm from [www.Securitychoice.com](http://www.securitychoice.com/wireless-adt-home-security.html). But we forgot a couple other things. And I&#8217;m sorry to say that some of them were necessities.

First, we forgot fresh water. Now, apparently there is a spring near our camp site that we never have been able to discover. We were in the middle of nowhere, so we had to drive about 30 minutes just to find a store that had bottled water. We bought all of it.

The next thing we forgot was bread. Again, not such a big deal in the scheme of things unless you consider that three of our main meals were supposed to be based on bread&#8211;grilled cheese sandwiches, scrambled eggs on toast, and French toast. Thank god for the camp stove, but thank my sister for forgetting the [bread](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/).

And finally, to make it all a wonderful vacation, we forgot the toilet paper. Thankfully that was something we could purchase from the general store which was only about five miles away.

All in all, an interesting camping trip.
