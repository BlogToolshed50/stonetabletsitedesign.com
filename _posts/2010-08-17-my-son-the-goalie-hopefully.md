Thanks to Erasmo Cortez

We are getting ready to leave for [soccer practice](http://soccerpracticevideoclips.blogspot.com/), this year my son is hoping to be the goalie. I can&#8217;t believe another season is here already; hopefully this one will go just as well as last season. I have to get all of my sons gear ready otherwise he will end up forgetting something that is much needed! I swear he would forget his head if it wasn&#8217;t screwed on. I guess I can cut him some slack since this is the first practice of the season.

It&#8217;s my night to bring snacks. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to bring so I settled on individual bags of chips, juice and apples. Hopefully that will be ok with the kids. I put everything by the front door to ensure that I don&#8217;t forget anything. Once we are ready I set our [perimeter alarm](http://www.allhomesecurity.com/ "perimeter alarm deal") and lock the door then we are on our way.

Well it&#8217;s time to go. Hopefully we will have an amazing practice. I can&#8217;t wait to see my son play; this is his first time playing as goalie! If he catches on and does well then he will get to be a backup goalie this season. I know he will do great.
