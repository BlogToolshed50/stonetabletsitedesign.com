Free software has many times created confusion in my mind as to why the companies should offer it free after putting time and money in developing it. But the people in business say that this is yet another method of improving the business and the market share. Any software given initially free become a necessity if the people started using it and a stage may come when they may not be able to live without the same. Distribution of free software has become a potentially profitable business model now adopted by many companies. It is an easy way to gain entry into the market by offering the free software so that the brand recognition is achieved apart from gaining the market share. Lots of free security products and anti virus software are offered free of cost to ensure the application by the computer users and ultimately make them as life long users on payment. I may suggest to those who are opting for such free products to be little cautious to avoid any harmful virus and protect themselves from phis hing scam. You should choose the trust worthy source of free software. One can really upon the free software offered by the leading manufacturers of software from whom a different software is already purchased. To avoid virus from such downloading, one need to combine a good anti virus program along with certain detective work on the internet.
