To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.&#8221;
  
- Ralph Waldo Emerson

When you find yourself in a rat race of getting ahead of others and impressing people, you tend to portray yourself as someone you are not. You say things which you don&#8217;t mean, you do things which you don&#8217;t intend to do; all this in an effort to impress someone or the other and make someone like you. And in the process you begin to lose your own individuality.

&#8220;To be ones self, and unafraid whether right or wrong, is more admirable than the easy cowardice of surrender to conformity.&#8221;
  
-Irving Wallace

It does not mean that you should not make efforts to create a good impression with people who matter to you. More importantly, you can always make an impression without faking it.

Quite often we waste our precious time pretending to be who we are not either to secure a job, get acceptance from peer groups, friends and family or to maintain a relationship with our partners. We wear clothes which are in vogue but they don&#8217;t suit us. We often tend to make decisions that will be accepted by others, knowing in our hearts that it may not be the right thing to do. But faking yourself wont make you happy in the end.

It is your misconception that if you pretend to be something else, only then people will like you. The truth is you have distinctive qualities that make you unique and people will surely like you for what you are. There is a phrase which says that it is better to be hated for what you are, than to be loved for what you are not.

&#8220;He who trims himself to suit everyone will soon whittle himself away.&#8221;
  
-Raymond Hull

Do not suppress your own true self from the fear of being ridiculed or rejected by society or for the want of acceptance in your college or workplace. It will only add to the frustration. It is also detrimental for your self-growth. Human beings are all unique and non-comparable. Each has his/her own unique talents, abilities, emotions and journey. There is no one like you and there will never be anyone like you ever. You have your own likes, dislikes and preferences which make you unique. Being yourself is more important than anything else.

“Be yourself. Above all, let who you are, what you are, what you believe, shine through every sentence you write, every piece you finish.”
  
- John Jakes

You possess unique talents, so work on them. If you have the ability to play with words, then start writing and publish your own blog. If you can make good music, pick up the instrument again and play some new tunes.

In other words, hone the unique talents and skills you have. Work on yourself to build up the confidence which allows you to be yourself. Listen to other people opinions but don&#8217;t get swayed by them. Rather trust yourself and do what you think is right. 

Inspirational words and success secrets shared by the brightest of minds often emphasize thinking for yourself and being yourself. Even the inspirational books and motivational sayings videos clearly demonstrate the importance of being your genuine self to attain success in all areas of life and assist in your personal development.

&#8220;Always be a first rate version of yourself and not a second rate version of someone else.&#8221;
  
-Judy Garland
