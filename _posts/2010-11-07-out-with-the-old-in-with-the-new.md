Guest post of the week by Jeffry Warren

Every morning this week I have woken up with a very sore back. I think this may have something to do with my mattress. It&#8217;s quite old and there are even bumps in it from the positions that I commonly sleep in. The mattress has been through a lot with me but it just may be time to say out with the old and in with the new. While I need a new mattress I do not need a new bedroom set but odds are I&#8217;ll just pick up one of those too. They always have sales at the furniture store in the center of town and it will be something strange like buy a mattress and get 20% off a bedroom set. They are pretty smart with their marketing to know that when you replace something in a room you start to imagine how great it would look will all brand new furniture.

I think I may get a pillow top bed that&#8217;s so soft that I melt into the big cushion. That will be absolutely perfect since there is a marathon on of CSI that I plan to watch on my [satellite tv hd dvr](http://www.expertsatellite.com/ "satellite tv hd dvr"). Good thing I make quick decisions because I&#8217;ll barely have enough time to pick out what I&#8217;d like and get it set up and home before the show begins. The beginning truly is the most important part. I hope I don&#8217;t fall asleep during the show since my new mattress will be so comfortable. I&#8217;ll probably have to wait for the rest of the items to shift but I think this [marathon](http://www.getyourserenity.com/) may be going on all weekend so at least I&#8217;ll be occupied.
