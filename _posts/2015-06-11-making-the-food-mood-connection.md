Food is more that just fuel for our bodies. What we eat &#8211; and when &#8211; has a major influence on the hormones that control our moods and emotional well-being, according to Sam Graci, nutritional researcher and author of the new book &#8211; The Food Connection: The Right Food at the Right Time.

For many Canadians, eating-on-the-go and opting for convenience foods &#8211; instead of healthy foods &#8211; is a way of life in today&#8217;s fast-paced, stress-filled society. Poor eating habits not only cause poor concentration, depression and fatigue, but they are making Canadians &#8220;hormonally&#8221; unhealthy. Foods that are high in cholesterol and fat are wreaking havoc on the hormones that control moods.

Serotonin is the hormone that regulates the body&#8217;s appetite, obsessive behaviors and cravings &#8211; and it also controls our moods. Getting just the right amount of this hormone will help keep the body emotionally fit &#8211; and prevent us from packing on unwanted pounds. However, too much serotonin can cause nausea and diarrhea, and too little can leave us feeling anxious, restless, depressed, impulsive and aggressive.

Balance your moods &#8211; and cravings &#8211; by eating protein at the right time of day and with the right amount of carbohydrates. It&#8217;s important to reduce protein during the day and increase the amount of complex carbohydrates such as ripe fruits and raw vegetables that we eat. Try a nutritional supplement such as greens+â„¢ &#8211; just one serving is the equivalent of six organic salads.

Each meal or snack has a major hormonal affect on our current mood, energy, mental clarity and emotional stability. Our last snack before bed will determine how well we&#8217;ll sleep during the night, and that sleep will have a direct impact on our appetite, motivation, energy, decisiveness and overall moods the following day. The next time you&#8217;re tempted to reach for a candy bar or bag of potato chips, think about the consequences it will have on your hormones &#8211; and your overall health.
