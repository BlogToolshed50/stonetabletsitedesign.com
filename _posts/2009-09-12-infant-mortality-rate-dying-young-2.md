The infant mortality rate is the number of children per 1,000 births who die in the first year of life. In the developing world, the rate has been decreasing because of improved sanitation, reduce level of infectious disease due to vaccination and better health education. The IMR rate in Central African Republic has declined from 107 per 1,000 in the 1950s to 96 per 1,000 in the 1990s. The IMR rate decreased 21 percent in the United States during the same period. Despite raid decline, infant mortality and mortality for children under five remains a greater problem in the Central African Republic than those of the developed world.

Children under five often suffer from malaria which affects the child&#8217;s physical and mental development and has long-term effects on their health. The national and international agencies can target health education and disease prevention initiatives more effectively.

In the developed world, it is easier to measure the mortality rates as there is more complete information on people&#8217;s health care by records of admissions. From these records a medical staff can calculate rates for specific diseases, including different forms of cancer, respiratory and infectious diseases such as TB, HIV/AIDS, influenza and measles. More than half of child deaths in developing countries are due to malnutrition.
