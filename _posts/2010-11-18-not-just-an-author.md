I think that learning more about your favorite authors, besides reading all the books that they write and sell, makes the books even better. So I do my best to try and learn a little bit about the authors before I read their books to try and better understand exactly why they wrote what they wrote. Sometimes, the authors&#8217; real lives are even more exciting!

One of my favorite current day authors that&#8217;s still living is John Grisham. I read a long time ago that he was a lawyer before he was an author, which explains why he really knows what he&#8217;s talking about. I keep up with all of his happenings with my [4G Internet](http://www.clear-internet.com/4g-internet-deals.html) and hope that he&#8217;ll continue to keep writing books for a very long time because I&#8217;ll keep reading them.

But I also like that [writer John Grisham](http://sentencing.typepad.com/sentencing_law_and_policy/2010/09/john-grisham-finds-mysterious-virginias-application-of-the-death-penalty.html) tries to use his influence in legal causes that he really believes in. But when it comes down to it, he really has a whole lot of influence because heÕs a popular author and a real lawyer, so people know who he is and what heÕs talking about.
