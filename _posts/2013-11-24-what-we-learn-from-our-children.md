There are hundreds of books on parenting, discipline, communication and relationships. The topics are so varied they range from managing your child’s anger, to anxiety, to difficult children, to creating respectful well- behaved children. I have yet to find the first book to ask what we can actually learn from children. What as parents and adults can we learn, not just teach? What have our experiences and responsibilities taken away from us? Maybe, we can find these answers by seeing our children.

My friend told me a story. He was in his home office and had removed his watch. Hours later he could not find it anywhere but remembered that his four year old was playing in his room. So he asked her, “did you take my watch?” She immediately turned around and said, “no!” So he then asked her “if I were a watch where would I be?” She immediately replied, “in a shoe.” He asked, “in a tennis shoe?” and she said “no, the ones you wear to work.” So, did she lie? Absolutely! But more important than scolding is noting how imaginative and creative the mind of a 4-year old can be.

Children do not have the pre-imposed belief system we have, they do not create judgments, they are open and honest (for the most part) but most important of all, they still hold an awe for life, an ability to be surprised constantly, to see the world as a magical place to be discovered. Can we learn this from them and be able to teach them something at the same time?

As the little ones grow up, in the infancy years, they are constantly demanding of time and energy. They keep us awake at night, changing diapers and feeding. They also make us slow time, e.g. the tree, the clouds, the butterfly, even the tiny insect on the ground is a new discovery. We should learn to see the world through their discovering and surprised eyes. We might even learn to slow down, look and listen, and take time to discover the world all over again. In that way we teach them to observe, communicate and talk.

As toddlers, they show their emotions without the slightest remorse or self control. Those terrible two years. In reality, they are wonderful twos. Growing up to be independent thinkers, explorers and inventors. We learn what can happen if anger gets out of control, we learn to control ourselves but we forget to explore and invent. Let the children teach us this, allow us to rediscover ourselves.

As they grow, they are constantly changing and demanding new things. They teach us to be creative in discipline strategies because the ones that used to work now don’t. They teach us to adapt to our environment and be flexible. If we approach parenting as a learning process it makes us constantly question our values, morality, behavior and goals. Life becomes a process of working towards achieving our greatest potential. Because from this point of view the rule becomes “do as a do, not as I say”.

So the next time you walk outside look for shapes in the clouds, take time to stare at the stars, question your goals and motives and know that life is full of wonderful surprises. When you see your friend or loved one’s watch, go and put it in their shoe—the ones they wear to work&#8230; learn to laugh and take life with flexibility.
