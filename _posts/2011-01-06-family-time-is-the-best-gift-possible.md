This year, instead of giving tangible gifts and doing all the regular stuff at home, my family and I decided that we wanted to pool our present money and do more experiential things as a family. The truth is that we donÕt get to see our two sons as often as we would like to. Instead of just sending each other off with little gifts at the end of our visit, we all thought we would do some more things together this Christmas and really make some memories in the limited about of time that we have together. My sons had absolutely no problem with the idea at all! The only gift regular gift that was exchanged was a special gift from my husband: a new pair of [Miracle Ear Digital Hearing Aids](http://www.miracle-ear.com/centersearchresult.aspx?stateName=Texas&state=TX). They were very much needed for me to enjoy the holidays.

The family got to go out to eat several times, and we went to an art museum, the movies, and we even went to a professional [hockey](http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-hockey/mich-m-hockey-body.html) game. It was great being able to do so much together in just a weeksÕ time. I donÕt think any of us could have thought of a better gift this year.
