This is a guest post by Tamara Daniels

My cousin just recently gave birth to her first son. Since we live on opposite sides of the country, I was unable to attend any of her baby showers or visit her after she brought her new born home. I wanted to send along a special gift but I hate going to the post office and shipping things. Instead, I decided to long on using my [hughesnet](http://www.satellitestarinternet.com/) satellite internet and find a gift to send directly to her. I knew that I wanted to send her a gift of organic baby clothes and toys so I found a great natural clothing website and started shopping. [Sandboxcouture.com](http://www.sandboxcouture.com/) had a great assortment of natural and organic clothing and toys for both boys and girls. The best part was the fact that they also offered gift wrapping and shipping. I picked out the items that I knew she would love and proceeded to the check out. The gift wrapping instructions were easy to read and follow. I followed all steps and was promised the gift would be delivered wrapped in a natural pillow box and tied with a raffia bow. They also offered personalized, unique gift tags. I was able to add a personal message at no extra cost. All together for the wrapping I paid less than $8.00, which was more than worth it for me.

She received the package within a week of arriving home from the hospital and sent me a picture of the beautiful wrapped clothing. It was perfect.
