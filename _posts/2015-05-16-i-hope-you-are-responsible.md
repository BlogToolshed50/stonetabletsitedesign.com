Where is Yesterday? Really where did it go? I mean, How can 24hrs just disappear&#8217;

Awareness, Education and Responsibility.

One of the best ways that i have found to build a healthy personailty involves understanding yourself and your feelings. This can be achieved through this simple exercise i like to call &#8220;Awareness, Education and Responsibility&#8221; or &#8220;Intentional Seeing&#8221;

Awareness 

You have to accept yourself for the person you are with good points and bad points with strengths and weaknesses&#8230;&#8230;

&#8230;.when you learn to develop the ability to stand back and look at yourself &#8220;honestly&#8221; and to candidly admit to others that you may not be perfect, but you&#8217;re all you got.

Maybe then, You will start to enjoy the heightened sense of &#8220;Intentional Seeing&#8221;

Your Future is in your eyes to see.

Education

Think about this, In order for you to become a Medical Doctor you have to go through some serious &#8220;education&#8221; likewise in order for you to become a Nurse also requires some &#8220;education&#8221;.

A Lawyer, A carpenter, A Teacher, A Fireman, A policeman, A Millionaire , An Architect, etc. etc.

Fill in the Blank 

You have to think about your future possibilities and the &#8220;fact&#8221; that your potential is virtually unlimited. You can be the person you want to be. You can set large and small goals and make plans (education) and move step by step progressively toward their realization.

There are no Obstacles to what you can accomplish, Except the ones you created.

And last but not least&#8230;..

&#8230;&#8230;Responsibility

You have to develop a perspective of what is causing you Unhappiness, then stand back from the situation and imagine the same thing happening to someone you love.

What advice will you give that person?

You know what ?

&#8220;If the mind can conceive it then you can achieve it&#8221;

I hope you are Responsible!

Be good.
