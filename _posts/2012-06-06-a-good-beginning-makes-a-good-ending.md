Where does one begin? At birth of course but the foundation of a new life begins in the parents much before the child is born. In biological terms there are genes that are the same and intellectually there are many similarities between the creative juices of parents and children. Finally it is the upbringing, exposure to relevant reality that actually gives shape to the person
  
In Indian Astrology, the beginning or the birth is signified by the Ascendant but what is hidden &#8211; the nadir remains in the depth of the 4th house of the Horoscope. This house also shows how is going to be the latter part of life.
  
This house is a very important part of the horoscope since it depicts the level of a person&#8217;s contentment or happiness in life. Signifying the mind it shows family, mother, domestic environment, level of education just to mention a few areas where it is significant.
  
Astrologers look at this house since no horoscope analysis is complete without taking the signatures affecting this house into consideration
  
The obvious reasons being:

* How is the mind?
      
* How does general education fare?
      
* How happy is the person?
      
* What is the domestic scene?
      
* What is the domestic scene?

The significator or Karaka of the 4th house is planet Venus and Moon. Both these planets are the main feminine energies that bring, harmony and softness in life. The planet Venus has to do with vehicles and happiness while Moon has to do with emotions, mother, home & family.
  
The horoscope has twelve houses and 7 planetary energies that are in control of them. The nodes Rahu & Ketu are shadowy planets and are not in power where Zodiac signs are concerned.
  
The nine planetary energies are closely interconnected and there is hardly any area of life that can be really taken as completely free of all their effects. However when they are directly connected to the 4th house, their influence is quite prominent and makes the life of the person shapes the future and consents harmony or disharmonious life. I give below some examples.
  
Effect of Sun on the 4th house often shows gain through inheritance, landed property and intelligence. Low or weak Sun can mean dishonor at later stage in life and difficulty in domestic area.
  
Effect of Moon on the 4th house can mean a harmonious childhood, loving mother/parents and basically a good beginning in life. Gain is indicated and it can also show changeable residence. A low or challenged Moon can mean turbulent childhood, emotionally stressed life, unfavorable conditions in mother&#8217;s life etc.
  
The above are generally applicable to horoscopes of different Ascendants. But to come back to the &#8216;beginning&#8217; theme, a strong planet, especially located in the 4th house, Moon or Venus can be a great boon.
