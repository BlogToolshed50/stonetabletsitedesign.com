Guest blog post from Patty Ingram

When I found out my dog was expecting puppies, I was clueless. I had no idea what to expect with the mother, the puppies, feeding, bathing, or anything! I decided to turn to the best place I could, my satellite internet that I just got by looking up the best [hughesnet plans](http://www.satelliteinternetbroadband.com/hughesnet_plans_pricing.html). Using the [hughes internet](http://www.satelliteinternetbroadband.com/) allowed me to research and find out exactly what was going to happen. I had no idea that having a puppy was going to be such an easy process for me, although I am sure my dog did not think the same.

After she gave birth to her three baby Chihuahuas, I was confident that we were going to be able to take care of them in the proper way. The mother was extremely comfortable with me around her puppies, which allowed me to change her bedding, and give her nice clean and warm sheets.

The [puppies](http://www.animaroo.com/) are only a few days old, but they are already moving around so much. They try to walk, and make little barking sounds to let their mom know that they have needs for her to satisfy. They are very smart and know what is going on, even though their eyes have not yet opened. I read online that they father should not be around the puppies, but I was surprised to find out that the mother actually likes him around because he acts as a guard dog to keep others away.
