People are treated for ill-health in a wide variety of places from home treatment to intensive care units in hospitals. In the developing world most of the clinics are poorly staffed and equipped. The areas that are in most need of health care receive the least. There are wide variations between rural and urban areas, and between different groups within societies and within particular region. The minority groups such as gypsies in Western Europe and refugees in many parts of the world experience more health problems than in the settled populations.

Health care has become a complex business in the developed world. The Western medicine tends to view the body as a machine that can be fixed and repaired. The primary health care is provided by the doctors who are general practitioners. Local clinics provide treatment where possible, followed up by specialists for severe cases. In the developing world the health care system is a less structured system. There are fewer hospitals and they are spread out in larger towns and cities and the access to health care is far less in the developing world.

The Chinese health is mainly based on the concept of patientâ€™s essential spirit which needs to be balanced correctly by herbal health care or by using acupuncture needles at certain parts of the body to restore the balance. These systems are ancient types of medicines referred to as alternative medicine.
