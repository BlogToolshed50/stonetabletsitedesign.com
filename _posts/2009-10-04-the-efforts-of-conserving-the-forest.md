We all know that the afforestation helps in so many ways to human life. Recent information from Ghana vouches it beyond doubt. It was quite interesting to note that, the concerted efforts of the people in a village at Ghana&#8217;s Volta region, brought a sea change in the micro climatic condition in the area for the people to prosper. The whole heated efforts of the village in a co ordinate manner helped to bring in copious rain to the village. The realization by the villagers after spoiling the atmosphere by the trees fell in the adjoining forest are over a period of time, helped them to reduce the intensity of the scorching sun by going in for tree planting and conserving the forest. 

Now it is certified that the place, Kakum is one of the bio diversity hot spots in the world for the park ranger Rockson Moro. The wonderful part of this great effort is the involvement of the government to offer the budgetary allocation. But the people are more interested to get the free saplings from the government rather than waiting for their financial assistance as they have enjoyed the fruit of the afforestation. If this strategy is followed by every one of the governments worldwide to conserve the forests and trees, there is no doubt that the humanity can enjoy the fruit of the nature. 

It is that from the extent of 63400 sq km in 1960 the forest area of Ghana shrinking to mere 13500 sq km when the project conservation started. Now the collective efforts of conserving the forest by fresh afforestation move has substantially increased the area under forest to bring cheers to the people. Why not every country follow this good example to help the humans?.
