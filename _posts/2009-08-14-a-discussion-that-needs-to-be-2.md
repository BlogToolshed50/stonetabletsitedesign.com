The present day world is witnessing turbulence everywhere. Be it on the economic front, or on the social front, a lot of untoward incidents are happening to affect the human life. It is high time that the various nations come together to stop further deterioration in the global dislocation. The acrimonious attitude towards different countries against each other must be stopped forthwith and a reconciliation path must be followed. The recent speech and message by the president of the United States is found to be in this line. His greetings and good words to the people of Iran on the eve of their independence day celebration is an encouraging note for the world peace.

Every nation should take this positive steps in removing the difference between them and try to divert their energy towards development and nation building. The role of the United Nations like organizations in this direction is to be improved and an amicable agreement is to arrived for mutual benefit. The developed countries must come out of the superiority complex and come to the rescue of the under developed countries at the time of such economic crisis. This as observed by many can be achieved by frequent meeting between the nations and formulating the needed strategy to go ahead on the economic and social front.
