Say &#8220;YES&#8221;
  
Say &#8220;yes&#8221; to life. Always be quick to take chances, try new things, and do things outside of your &#8220;comfort zone.&#8221; Huge opportunities for personal growth and gaining life experience occur when you do this.

I never failed to hitch a ride home in a convertible with one of our volunteers whenever the weather was suitable when I worked up at Mount St. Helens. I believe life includes riding with the top down and taking that long put off vacation.

We don&#8217;t want to reach the end of our days and wish we had taken more chances, danced with that boy who asked, or tried Bouillabaisse just once. It might be too late then. Helen Keller has a great quote that is written on an artistic card in my bedroom window, &#8220;Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.&#8221;

My favorite song of all time is LeAnn Womack&#8217;s I Hope You Dance. I can listen to it over and over, and each time it leaves me more inspired. My favorite line in the song is &#8220;When you get the chance to sit it out or danceâ€¦I hope you dance.&#8221; Use this as a motto for your life, it will serve you well.

Take off Your Brakes Confidently
  
I have a friend who is constantly on the go. I went to Costa Rica with her and she would drag me out of bed at five in the morning to go bird watching. We went horseback riding, white water rafting, hiking, and took a thrilling canopy tour where we zipped on a cable through the rainforest. Did I mention that she&#8217;s in her late seventies? Don&#8217;t tell her that because she just might start acting her age. Go ahead and live a little-sign up for that ballroom dance class if it moves you. Take that vacation you&#8217;ve always wanted to.

Americans take fewer vacations than people in any other developed nation. Why? A life with all work and no spontaneous adventures is not much of a life at all. Don&#8217;t wait until the perfect time for it may never come.

Find a Way to Live Your Vision
  
My grandma Clara always wanted to go to Scotland. She dreamed of it and talked about it profusely. She even had a set of Scotland videos that she would watch and a beautiful pair of Scottish dolls.

She never went to Scotland. She never had the money or the health, but if you want something badly enough you can find a way. She has over fifty children and grandchildren and their spouses who live within 20 miles. If we all pitched in a little cash we could have sent her easily to Scotland with one of us along for assistance. My biggest regret is that we didn&#8217;t do enough to send her. Now it is too late.

Everyone has a Scotland-a dream or adventure that they feel is to big to even attempt to accomplish. But you don&#8217;t want to reach the end of your days and be saddled with a list of regrets. What are you waiting for? Take that cruise, buy that convertible, and sign up for that class that you&#8217;ve wanted to take. Don&#8217;t just talk about it-like my grandmother did. Life is about taking chances. Go for it!

Life is not a dress rehearsal. Create your best life possible by saying &#8220;yes&#8221; to what life sends you
