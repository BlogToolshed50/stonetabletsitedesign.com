Day care also called a cr√®che in Queen&#8217;s English, means child being taken care of by a person who is not a parent or guardian of the child. Day care is also termed childcare in some countries. Day care is not only an issue about proper care of your child it becomes sensitive too. Your small child is away from you and being taken care of by third person. Obviously, you have to be careful while selecting day care center for your child.

Location plays a vital role in selecting the day care center. You have to drop your child in the morning and pick up in the evening. Your child should not be penalized for traffic delays. Avoid evaluating a day care facility on a Sunday. Try to do that on a weekday during peak hours.

Costs make up another critical components in day care facility selection process. You shouldn&#8217;t have any surprises later. You should know in advance about all the costs involved. Try to cover all the costs so as not to face any hidden costs in the later stage.

Consider all the infrastructure features at the center. What types of other children are being enrolled into the center? What age group do other children belong to. How many people are staffing the operations in the center. Are there any back up facilities in case the main caretaker falls sick. What type of civil structure the center is located at. Is it enough for that many children? 

Look for the timing of the center. You should carefully consider this parameter. The timing must be in tune with your needs. You should also try to know from the center about the state of childcare if you arrive late from your workplace. Holidays and leaves also decide the suitability of the day care center for your child. Some centers may strictly be closed on all the key holidays while some may be open on key holidays, but charge extra amounts for care facilities.

Carefully weigh the accredited and non-accredited centers. You should know the reasons about non-accreditation. Ask for the training courses undergone by the provider.Last but not the least plan in advance. Some of the more successful day care centers may have a long waiting list. You should assess your day care requirements in advance and therefore register yourself. Always have two to three choices open before taking a final call on selection.
