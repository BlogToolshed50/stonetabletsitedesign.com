Guest post written by Sally Beatty

When I moved in with my new roommate, I expected for her to have all these great books that I could borrow and read because she&#8217;s going ot school to be a librarian. We actually met in a book club so I knew that we had our love for reading in common already. But once I moved in I saw a whole shelf in her living room was dedicated to Baby Sitters Club books.

We were wondering about how many books were in the book series and I was looking to figure it out when I ran across teh website [clearwirelessinternet.net](http://www.clearwirelessinternet.net/clear-internet-deals.html) and read through it. Then we talked it over and decided to change our internet to it.

I don&#8217;t think that we ever found a definite total for all the [Baby Sitters Club books](http://www.melissacwalker.com/blog/2010/01/bonus_cover_stories_the_babysi.html), so I just concentrated on reading a few instead. It was so long ago that I had read them growing up that I had completely forgotten about which ones I had read and which ones I hadn√ït. All I could remember vaguely was the characters.
