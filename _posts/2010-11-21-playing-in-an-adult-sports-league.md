One of most anticipated activities of the summer months is without a doubt playing in the local recreational men&#8217;s softball league. I have been doing this for well over 10 years and while the good days of my baseball career are far gone, I can still relive those glory days by playing in the softball league.

There is no better feeling that going in the garage getting my bat bag, setting the[Adt security](http://www.securitychoice.com/adt-home-security/New-York/) alarm, then hopping in my truck to the short ride out to the ball field. We try and practice as much as we can and we have about two doubleheader games a week. I do a little pitching but I mainly play first base and outfield. I have also played some designated hitter and it is the hitting part of the game that keeps me want to play so bad.

There is no better feeling than stepping up to the plate and being able to hit one over the fence. I am not the best hitter on the team but I have been able to hit some shots out of the park. I love the comraderie with my teammates and I just love to go out and play the game. There is no better feeling in the [summertime](http://www.summertimefilm.com/wordpress/ "summertime site").
