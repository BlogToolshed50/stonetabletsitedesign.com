Each and everyone of us can surely say at one time or another we have been tested, tried and pushed into situations we weren’t proud of. In spite of what the situations have been – we have to learn to hold onto our peace. Going pass peace will cause frustration and a lot of time results in a moment of resentment. Having our buttons pushed is not a pleasant thing, however continually speaking God’s Word to any mountain in our life, will allow maturity in that area of our life. The Word is the beginning of everything! Planting the Word in our mouth and our heart results in transformation.

When we learn to hold onto our peace, it is a sure sign of maturity and growth. Everyday is not going to be the same. The enemy will surely try his game. Even if it results in an unpleasant situation, we have to remind ourselves who we are in Christ. We can’t let condemnation take root in our life.

Holding onto our peace will allow us to go to another level. It will cause advancements and promotions to come our way for the mere fact that we surrendered to the Word of God. The peace God gave us is for us. It is not intended for issues to rob us instantly of our peace. Losing our keys, hung-up in traffic, and the children acting like they have lost their mind is just a few situations that sometimes come upon us. God will allow us to continue to go around the same mulberry bush until we totally surrender and show we are ready for the next level.

Peace is so powerful! It will prevent you from making a wrong decision. Whenever you are somewhere you don’t belong – peace will allow you to be uncomfortable. Never go past your peace.
