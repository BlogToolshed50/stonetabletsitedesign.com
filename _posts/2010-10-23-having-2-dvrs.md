The article written by Alonso Kramer

In my home, there are two different DVRs set up on two separate receivers provided by [tvbydirect.com](http://www.tvbydirect.com/directv-deals.html). The DVR has become a necessity in our home, to say the least. It is not uncommon for us to have items recording on all available portals on both of our DVR systems. One TV is used primarily by my husband, while the other is used mostly for &#8220;my&#8221; shows. Without our DVR it would be nearly impossible to see the shows I prefer to watch, since so many of them come on at the same times or on the same days. In addition, having a second receiver with DVR is very helpful because it allows me to keep up with the things I want to watch, in which my husband has no interest, without my husband having to miss his programs. For me, personally, the DVR is a lifesaver that has kept me working out. I used to have trouble completing my daily morning workouts until the second DVR was installed. Now, I am able to record shows I love to watch in the evenings and view them during my daily morning workout sessions. The DVR is something that we could not do without, and both my [husband](http://thehusbandblog.wordpress.com/) and I plan to always have a DVR available in our home.
