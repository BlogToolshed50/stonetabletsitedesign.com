Colorado Springs sets a sumptuous table of restaurants to choose from. Our city has just about every ethnic dish that you can think of. The hardest part about dining out in this city is whether or not the group will ever decide where it&#8217;s going to eat. The usual gang of suspects were gathered at my house when we decided that lunch was a good idea so I set my [adt security](http://www.allhomesecurity.com/) alarm and off we went.

Briargate Mart is a cozy restaurant/market. If you have been there at least once then it&#8217;s guaranteed that the family owners will recognize you. Middle Eastern food has different tastes and textures that the average American doesn&#8217;t experience. Food names like hummus and baba ghanoush can make one wonder about the actual ingredients of any given dish but the owners will gladly walk you through the ingredients and preparation of their dishes. After the grand tour of the posted menu, most of us went with safety and ordered the Gyro sandwich platter.The food is always fresh and served hot.

Even though my neighborhood is not really ethnically diverse it always amazes me how diverse the patrons are of this restaurant. It makes for a lively atmosphere and interesting conversation with those around me. The restaurant with its intimate setting lends itself well to reaching out and interacting other people. The owner like to talk with guests and make everyone feel comfortable. Briargate Mart is always one of my favorite hang outs for a good meal.
